# System information
system.desc=A blue social bookmark and publication sharing system.
system.about={0} is a system for sharing bookmarks and lists of literature. When discovering a bookmark or a publication on the web, you can store it on our server. You can add tags to your post to retrieve it more easily. This is very similar to the bookmarks/favorites that you store within your browser. The advantage of {0} is that you can access your data from  whereever you are. Furthermore, you can discover more bookmarks and publications from your friends and other people.
system.introduction=This page shows you the latest updates of {0}. Why don't you just try it yourself? After a free <a href="/register">registration</a>, you can organise your own bookmarks and publications, and discover related entries.
system.offeredBy={0} is offered by the <a href="{1}">Knowledge and Data Engineering Group</a> of the University of Kassel, Germany.
system.contact=Contact:
system.groups=If you want a group added to the system, create a user account \
with the desired group name and write an e-mail to \
<a href="mailto:webmaster@bibsonomy.org">webmaster@bibsonomy.org</a>. \
Groups help you to get an aggregated overview of its member's \
posts as well as to make posts visible for group members only. \
