    abstract = { The volatile constituents of the essential oil of wild Melissa officinalis L. obtained from the Kurdistan province of Iran were extracted by headspace/solid-phase micro-extraction and were analysed by gas chromatography and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Of a total of 14 compounds in the oil, 12 (85.7\%) were identified. The main components were as follows: (E)-citral (37.2\%), neral (23.9\%) and citronellal (20.3\%). Some physicochemical properties, such as the logarithm of calculated octanol–water partitioning coefficients (log K ow), total biodegradation (TB d in mol h−1 and g h−1), water solubility (S w, mg L−1 at 25°C) and median lethal concentration 50 (LC50), were calculated for compounds 1–14 from M. officinalis L. }
