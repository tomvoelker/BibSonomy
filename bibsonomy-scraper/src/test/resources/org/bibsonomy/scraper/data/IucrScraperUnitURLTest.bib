,abstract = {In the Er&#8211;Ge system, the compostion range ErGe2 to Er2Ge3 has been investigated. Eight samples were produced by arc melting of the elements, and analyzed using X-ray powder diffraction. Nine crystal structures were found to be present in the samples. The structures are described as a homologous series and presented within the superspace formalism using the superspace group X2/m(&#945;0&#947;)0s, X representing the centring vector (&#189;, &#189;, 0, &#189;). In this description the modulation vector q = (&#945;a* + &#947;c*) is shown to be a direct measure of the Ge content as ErGe2&#8197;&#8722;&#8197;&#945; (&#945; falls in the range 1\over 3 to &#189;). The large composition range is achieved by extended vacancy ordering in the planar 63 net of Ge with subsequent relaxation."}
