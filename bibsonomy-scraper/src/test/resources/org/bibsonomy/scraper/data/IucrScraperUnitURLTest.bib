,abstract = {In the Er-Ge system, the compostion range ErGe2 to Er2Ge3 has been investigated. Eight samples were produced by arc melting of the elements, and analyzed using X-ray powder diffraction. Nine crystal structures were found to be present in the samples. The structures are described as a homologous series and presented within the superspace formalism using the superspace group X2/m(0)0s, X representing the centring vector (�, �, 0, �). In this description the modulation vector q = (a* + c*) is shown to be a direct measure of the Ge content as ErGe2 - ( falls in the range to �). The large composition range is achieved by extended vacancy ordering in the planar 63 net of Ge with subsequent relaxation."}
