abstract = {The essential oil of Dracocephalum moldavica L from Xinjiang in China was isolated by hydrodistillation in yield of 0.15 %(w/w). The chemical composition of the essential oil was analyzed by GC and GCMS. Fifty-one compounds accounting for 99.45% of the total oil were identified. The major components werea-Citral (32.55%), &#946;-Citral (23.53%), Acetic acid, geranial ester(21.32%), Trans-Geraniol(3.38%), Nerolacetate(3.38%), Octane(2.14%), and 2,4,6-Trimethyl -3-cyclohexene-1-carboxaldehyde (1.3%). Monotenepers were the main group of compounds.},
