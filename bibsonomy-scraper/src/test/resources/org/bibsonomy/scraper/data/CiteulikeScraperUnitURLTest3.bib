    abstract = {This paper discusses the concept, application, and usefulness of software design patterns for scientific programming in Fortran 90/95. An example from the discipline of object-oriented design patterns, that of a game based on navigation through a maze, is used to describe how some important patterns can be implemented in Fortran 90/95 and how the progressive introduction of design patterns can usefully restructure Fortran software as it evolves. This example is complemented by a discussion of how design patterns have been used in a real-life simulation of Particle-in-Cell plasma physics. The following patterns are mentioned in this paper: Factory, Strategy, Template, Abstract Factory and Facade.Program summary Program title: mazev1, mazev2, mazev3 Catalogue identifier: AEAI\_v1\_0 Program summary URL: http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/AEAI\_v1\_0.html Program obtainable from: CPC Program Library, Queen's University, Belfast, N.

The programs implement a simple maze game similar to that described in [1]. Solution method: Restructuring uses versions of the Template, Strategy and Factory design patterns.
