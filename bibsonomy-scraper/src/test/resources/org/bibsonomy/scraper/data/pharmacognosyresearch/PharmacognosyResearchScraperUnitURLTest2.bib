abstract = {Pandemic coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the newly discovered virus {\textquotedblleft}Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoronaVirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2){\textquotedblright}. Considering the present scenario of COVID-19 outbreak and its impact on humankind, holistic remedies with respect to herbal medicine validated from ethnopharmacological rationale are now targeting approaches globally as a preventive care against SARS-CoV-2. <strong>Aim: </strong>This review is primarily focused on to deliver a concise fact of the coronaviridae family, pathophysiology, mechanism of action, ethnopharmacological validated Indian herbs for inhibiting the virus with possible targets. <strong>Experimental procedure: </strong>In this study, science mapping tool Bibliometrix R-package was used to perform bibliometric analysis and building data matrices for keywords co-occurrence investigation, country-wise scientific production; collaboration between the countries worldwide, co-word analysis on topic {\textquotedblleft}keywords associated with SARS-CoV-2 and medicinal plants{\textquotedblright}. <strong>Results and Conclusion:</strong> Our findings is to deliver a concise knowledge about the coronaviridae family, pathophysiology, possible targets for managing the SARS-CoV-2, in addition to potential medicinal plants and their phytoconstituents against COVID-19. Target-specific inflammatory pathways due to post infection of SARS e.g. NLRP3, p38-MAPK, Metallopeptidase Domain 17; endocytosis pathways e.g. Clathrin, HMGB1 pathways are primarily highlighted along with relevant interleukins and cytokines, which directly/indirectly triggering to immune system and play a significant role. Based on selective pathways and potential lead, the outcome of our elaborated study put forward selected Indian medicinal plants that hold a very high probability as preventive care in this global crisis.</p>
