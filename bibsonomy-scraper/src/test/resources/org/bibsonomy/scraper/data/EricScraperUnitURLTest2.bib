abstract = {Some three-way factor analysis and multidimensional scaling models incorporate the principle of parallel proportional profiles of R. B. Cattell. Proof is presented for a unique axis orientation for a more general parallel profiles model that incorporates interacting dimensions. Special cases of PARAFAC2 and CANDECOMP models are discussed.
