abstract = {The essential oil of Dracocephalum moldavica L from Xinjiang in China was isolated by hydrodistillation in yield of 0.15 \%(w/w). The chemical composition of the essential oil was analyzed by GC and GCMS. Fifty-one compounds accounting for 99.45\% of the total oil were identified. The major components wereα-Citral (32.55\%),β-Citral (23.53\%), Acetic acid, geranial ester(21.32\%), Trans-Geraniol(3.38\%), Nerolacetate(3.38\%), Octane(2.14\%), and 2,4,6-Trimethyl -3-cyclohexene-1-carboxaldehyde (1.3\%). Monotenepers were the main group of compounds.</p>
