abstract = {The methanolic supernatant fraction (MSF) of the aqueous extract of <em>Momordica cymbalaria </em>fruits when given to streptozotocin (STZ) induced diabetic rats showed a significant reduction (65.9\%, <em>P</em>\<0.001) in fasting blood glucose levels at a dose of 0.5g/kg.b.w. These results were compared to that of glibenclamide, an oral hypoglycemic agent. The active MSF exhibited a dose dependent scavenging activity against 2, 2-diphenly-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radicals and nitric oxide radicals with an IC<sub>50 </sub>value of 42.5 and 157.2μg/ml, respectively. Further, the MSF had relatively lower reducing power, compared to that of ascorbic acid. The total phenolic content of the fraction was found to be 132mg/gm of dry fraction. In conclusion, MSF possess antihyperglycemic and antioxidant properties, which could be due to the presence of steroidal glycosides or phenolic compounds.</p>
