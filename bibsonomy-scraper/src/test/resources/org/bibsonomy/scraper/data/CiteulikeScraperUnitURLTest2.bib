in the form of keywords to shared content. Recently, collaborative tagging has
grown in popularity on the web, on sites that allow users to tag bookmarks,
photographs and other content. In this paper we analyze the structure of
collaborative tagging systems as well as their dynamical aspects. Specifically,
we discovered regularities in user activity, tag frequencies, kinds of tags
used, bursts of popularity in bookmarking and a remarkable stability in the
relative proportions of tags within a given url. We also present a dynamical
model of collaborative tagging that predicts these stable patterns and relates
them to imitation and shared knowledge.},

@misc{citeulike:1286088,
	abstract = {Collaborative tagging has recently attracted the attention of both industry
and academia due to the popularity of content-sharing systems such as
CiteULike, del.icio.us, and Flickr. These systems give users the opportunity to
add data items and to attach their own metadata (or tags) to stored data. The
result is an effective content management tool for individual users. Recent
studies, however, suggest that, as tagging communities grow, the added content
and the metadata become harder to manage due to an ease in content diversity.
Thus, mechanisms that cope with increase of diversity are fundamental to
improve the scalability and usability of collaborative tagging systems. This
paper analyzes whether usage patterns can be harnessed to improve navigability
in a growing knowledge space. To this end, it presents a characterization of
two collaborative tagging communities that target scientific literature:
CiteULike and Bibsonomy. We explore three main directions: First, we analyze
the tagging activity distribution across the user population. Second, we define
new metrics for similarity in user interest and use these metrics to uncover
the structure of the tagging communities we study. The structure we uncover
suggests a clear segmentation of interests into a large number of individuals
with unique preferences and a core set of users with interspersed interests.
Finally, we offer preliminary results that demonstrate that the interest-based
structure of the tagging community can be used to facilitate content usage as
communities scale.},

	abstract = {Social bookmark tools are rapidly emerging on the Web. In such systems users are setting up lightweight conceptual structures called folksonomies. The reason for their immediate success is the fact that no specific skills are needed for participating. At the moment, however, the information retrieval support is limited. We present a formal model and a new search algorithm for folksonomies, called FolkRank, that exploits the structure of the folksonomy. The proposed algorithm is also applied to find communities within the folksonomy and is used to structure search results. All findings are demonstrated on a large scale dataset.},

	abstract = {Collaborative tagging systems allow users to assign keywords—so called “tags”—to resources. Tags are used for navigation, finding resources and serendipitous browsing and thus provide an immediate benefit for users. These systems usually include tag recommendation mechanisms easing the process of finding good tags for a resource, but also consolidating the tag vocabulary across users. In practice, however, only very basic recommendation strategies are applied. In this paper we evaluate and compare two recommendation algorithms on large-scale real life datasets: an adaptation of user-based collaborative filtering and a graph-based recommender built on top of FolkRank. We show that both provide better results than non-personalized baseline methods. Especially the graph-based recommender outperforms existing methods considerably.},
