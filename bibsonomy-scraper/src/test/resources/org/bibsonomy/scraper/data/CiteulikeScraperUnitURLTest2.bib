Tags are used for navigation, finding resources and serendipitous browsing and thus provide an immediate benefit for users. These systems usually include tag recommendation mechanisms easing the process of finding good tags for a resource, but also consolidating the tag vocabulary across users. In practice, however, only very basic recommendation strategies are applied.},

The community structure of such systems attracts spammers: recent post pages, popular pages or specific tag pages can be manipulated easily. As a result, searching or tracking recent posts does not deliver quality results annotated in the community, but rather unsolicited, often commercial, web sites. To retain the benefits of sharing one's web content, spam-fighting mechanisms that can face the flexible strategies of spammers need to be developed.},

@inproceedings{oldenburg08,
    abstract = {Recent growth of social classification systems due to steadily increasing popularity has established a multitude of heterogeneous isolated, non-integrated, and non-interoperable tag spaces. Contrary to current research predominantly focusing on single folksonomies, we exploit cross-space similarities to improve a variety of tagging use cases beyond the limits of one folksonomy. This paper presents the results of practical studies concerning cross-space analysis of (co-)tag spaces of five well-established social classification services for tagging of bookmarks (del.icio.us, BibSonomy bookmarks), and publications (BibSonomy publications, CiteULike, Connotea). The studies are based on one month data sets of RSS recent feeds from the same time scope. We provide a profound motivation for cross-space tagging, and give insight into similarities and intersections of (top ranking) (co-)tag spaces as well as convergence aspects over time.},

The computational demands of such simulations, however, have historically prevented them from reaching the microsecond and greater timescales on which these events often occur. Recent advances in algorithms, software, and computer hardware have made microsecond-timescale simulations with tens of thousands of atoms practical, with millisecond-timescale simulations on the horizon. This review outlines these advances in high-performance molecular dynamics simulation and discusses recent applications to studies of protein dynamics and function as well as experimental validation of the underlying computational models.},

The reason for their immediate success is the fact that no specific skills are needed for participating. At the moment, however, the information retrieval support is limited. We present a formal model and a new search algorithm for folksonomies, called FolkRank, that exploits the structure of the folksonomy. The proposed algorithm is also applied to find communities within the folksonomy and is used to structure search results. All findings are demonstrated on a large scale dataset.},

@misc{citeulike:1286088,
    abstract = {Collaborative tagging has recently attracted the attention of both industry
and academia due to the popularity of content-sharing systems such as
CiteULike, del.icio.us, and Flickr. These systems give users the opportunity to
add data items and to attach their own metadata (or tags) to stored data. The
result is an effective content management tool for individual users. Recent
studies, however, suggest that, as tagging communities grow, the added content
and the metadata become harder to manage due to an ease in content diversity.
Thus, mechanisms that cope with increase of diversity are fundamental to
improve the scalability and usability of collaborative tagging systems. This
paper analyzes whether usage patterns can be harnessed to improve navigability
in a growing knowledge space. To this end, it presents a characterization of
two collaborative tagging communities that target scientific literature:
CiteULike and Bibsonomy. We explore three main directions: First, we analyze
the tagging activity distribution across the user population. Second, we define
new metrics for similarity in user interest and use these metrics to uncover
the structure of the tagging communities we study. The structure we uncover
suggests a clear segmentation of interests into a large number of individuals
with unique preferences and a core set of users with interspersed interests.
Finally, we offer preliminary results that demonstrate that the interest-based
structure of the tagging community can be used to facilitate content usage as
communities scale.},

we discovered regularities in user activity, tag frequencies, kinds of tags
