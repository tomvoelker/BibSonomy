  abstract={A new class of many-body models is identified and investigated. Just as those we recently discovered, these many-body problems are solvable provided the initial data satisfy certain constraints; for such data the solution of the initial-value problem can be achieved via algebraic operations, such as finding the zeros of known polynomials. Entirely isochronous subclasses of these models are also exhibited, whose generic solutions are completely periodic with the same fixed period in their entire phase space.}
