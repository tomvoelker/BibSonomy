	abstract = "BPurpose/B - A report on the Charleston Conference, November 2009. BDesign/methodology/approach/B - Summarizes the presentations, reports, plenary sessions and panels. BFindings/B - Both collection development and acquisitions are changing rapidly as a result of the libraries trying to meet the needs of their users. Libraries now own less material and subscribe to many more. E-resources provide both problems and solutions forcing a new level of cooperation between librarians and vendors. Ways to describe materials such as the semantic web are being discussed. The Google settlement also has many implications for libraries. BPractical implications/B - Libraries must keep current as to changes in the materials available, especially e-resources and be prepared to negotiate with their vendors in order to agree on prices and conditions of licensing. The proliferation of e-resources by subscription is changing the way libraries acquire and provide materials. BOriginality/value/B - This paper provides as up-to-date review of a conference which focuses on acquisitions and collection development issues.",
