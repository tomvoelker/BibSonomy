Abstract = {{Collaborative tagging systems allow users to assign keywords - so
   called ``tags{''} - to resources. Tags are used for navigation, finding
   resources and serendipitous browsing and thus provide an immediate
   benefit for users. These systems usually include tag recommendation
   mechanisms easing the process of finding good tags for a resource, but
   also consolidating the tag vocabulary across users. In practice,
   however, only very basic recommendation strategies are applied.
   In this paper we evaluate and compare several recommendation algorithms
   on large-scale real life datasets: an adaptation of user-based
   collaborative filtering, a graph-based recommender built on top of the
   FolkRank algorithm, and simple methods based on counting tag
   occurrences. We show that both FolkRank and collaborative filtering
   provide better results than non-personalized baseline methods.
   Moreover, since methods based on counting tag occurrences are
   computationally cheap, and thus usually preferable for real time
   scenarios, we discuss simple approaches for improving the performance
   of such methods. We show, how a simple recommender based on counting
   tags from users and resources can perform almost as good as the best
   recommender.}},
