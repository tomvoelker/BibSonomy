Abstract = {{All increasing number of computational and statistical approaches have
   been used for text classification, including nearest-neighbor
   classification, naive Bayes classification, support vector machines,
   decision tree induction, rule induction, and artificial neural
   networks. Among these approaches, naive Bayes classifiers have been
   widely used because of its simplicity. Due to the simplicity of the
   Bayes formula, the naive Bayes classification algorithm requires a
   relatively small number of training data and shorter time in both the
   training and classification stages as compared to other classifiers.
   However, a major short coming of this technique is the fact that the
   classifier will pick the highest probability category as the one to
   which the document is annotated too. Doing this is tantamount to
   classifying using only one dimension of a multi-dimensional data set.
   The plain aim of this work is to utilize the strengths of the self
   organizing map (SOM) to overcome the inadvertent dimensionality
   reduction resulting from using only the Bayes formula to classify.
   Combining the hybrid system with new ranking techniques further
   improves the performance of the proposed document classification
   approach. This work describes the implementation of an enhanced hybrid
   classification approach which affords a better classification accuracy
   through the utilization of two familiar algorithms, the naive Bayes
   classification algorithm which is used to vectorize the document using
   a probability distribution and the self organizing map (SOM) clustering
   algorithm which is used as the multi-dimensional unsupervised
   classifier. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},
