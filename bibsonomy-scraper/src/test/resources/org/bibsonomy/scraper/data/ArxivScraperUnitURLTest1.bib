abstract = {  This paper is a survey of a large number of informal definitions of
``intelligence'' that the authors have collected over the years. Naturally,
compiling a complete list would be impossible as many definitions of
intelligence are buried deep inside articles and books. Nevertheless, the
70-odd definitions presented here are, to the authors' knowledge, the largest
and most well referenced collection there is.
