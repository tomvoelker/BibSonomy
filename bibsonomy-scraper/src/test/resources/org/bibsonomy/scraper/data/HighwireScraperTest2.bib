	abstract = {Poverty and low socioeconomic status have been associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The current financial crisis has forced millions back into poverty. Greece is one of the countries hit the hardest, and is in the middle of a deep ongoing collapse. There have been early reports stating the apparent effects of the Greek downturn on respiratory health. This review summarises the overall impact of the financial crisis on COPD burden throughout the period of economic downturn by analysing the case study of Greece. In all levels of the healthcare system, current economic restrictions have reduced the capacity to prevent, diagnose and treat COPD in parallel with current higher detection rates of COPD. Remarkably, expenditure on healthcare has been reduced by \&gt;25\%, resulting in major healthcare equipment shortages. Lower wages (by up to 20\%) and higher co-payments of up to 25\% of a drug{\textquoteright}s purchase price have led to patients struggling to afford inhaled medications. Treatment nonadherence has been reported, resulting in 11.5\% more exacerbations and 14.1\% more hospitalisations annually, while the mean cost per severe COPD exacerbation has been approximated as {\texteuro}2600. Greece is a noteworthy example illustrating how COPD burden, quality of care and patients{\textquoteright} outcome can be affected by economic crisis.Greece has been suffering a high burden of COPD, which has profoundly deteriorated due to the economic crisis http://ow.ly/eXc030hf934},
