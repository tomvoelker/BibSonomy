,abstract = {The need for an accurate description of the electronic structure of the important laseractive ion Nd3+ stimulated this work. We calculated self-consistent-field wave functions by the analytical-expansion method for the ground state of the laser-active ion Nd3+(Z=60), 4f3, I4. The results represent the most accurate wave functions for Nd3+ published. All the exponents of the basis functions in the analytical expansion were exhaustively optimized. The virial theorem was satisfied to seven significant figures. Values of 〈rn〉 for the 4f orbital are included.}
