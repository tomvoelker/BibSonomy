abstract = { This article first revises graph-theoretical (local aromaticity and overall molecular) indices, introduced by M. RandiÄ in 1975, for benzenoid hydrocarbons and somewhat improves them for computer enumeration. This goes beyond total KekulÃ© structure enumeration, yielding an index calculation useful for the quantitative estimation of localization of different KekulÃ©an substructures (including ethylene-, benzene-, annulene-, and radialene-units). This may be viewed as a âmolecules-in moleculeâ approach to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons within the context of graph theoretical partitioning. }
