abstract = { This article first revises graph-theoretical (local aromaticity and overall molecular) indices, introduced by M. Randic in 1975, for benzenoid hydrocarbons and somewhat improves them for computer enumeration. This goes beyond total Kekule structure enumeration, yielding an index calculation useful for the quantitative estimation of localization of different Kekulean substructures (including ethylene-, benzene-, annulene-, and radialene-units). This may be viewed as a molecules-in molecule approach to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons within the context of graph theoretical partitioning. }
