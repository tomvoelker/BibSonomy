note = {{This poster presents a set of hash keys for bibliographic records called bibkeys. Unlike other methods of duplicate detection, bibkeys can directly be calculated from a set of basic metadata fields (title, authors/editors, year). It is shown how bibkeys are used to map similar bibliographic records in BibSonomy and among distributed library catalogs and other distributed databases.}},
