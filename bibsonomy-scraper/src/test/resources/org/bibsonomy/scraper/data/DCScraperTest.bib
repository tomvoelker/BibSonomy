abstract = {The Web in general, and the Web 2.0, in particular, have changed the way in which scientific information is created, exchanged and consumed. Online accessible digital libraries bring the access to large collection of scientific literature to the research community. Information sharing and research results dissemination are much faster than before. The large amount of scientific data available on the Web gives unique opportunities and also raise challenges for understanding the organization and diffusion of scientific knowledge, and the ability to quickly locate information needed to perform research. The basic interest of this thesis is to study the structure of scientific knowledge domains from a social network view. Techniques developed in knowledge mapping typically focus on purely mental perspectives of scientific knowledge, while ignoring its social aspects. We study the social structures that shape the scientific knowledge domains. We propose a framework based on social network analysis, that allows us to analyze knowledge domains and the development pattern of research communities. To demonstrate, we analyze the dynamics of the computer science knowledge domain. We find interesting patterns regarding its interdisciplinary nature, the collaboration behavior and the development of communities in sub-disciplines. The results are useful for research funding agencies, scientific policy management, institution leaders, librarians, collection managers and research community members. Another important aspect of understanding knowledge domains and their behavior, especially research communities, is the community-based recommendation. We propose a framework that takes into account community recommendations for their members. The framework discovers communities from the research interaction between scholars as well as librarial objects (publications, conferences/journals, etc.). The applications and evaluations of this framework in two recommendation problems, community recommendation and talk/collaborator recommendation for conference participants, demonstrate the effectiveness and benefit of communities in supporting their members.},
