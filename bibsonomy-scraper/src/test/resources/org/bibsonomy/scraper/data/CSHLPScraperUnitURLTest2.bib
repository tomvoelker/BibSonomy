abstract ={During mammalian brain development, neural progenitor cells undergo symmetric proliferative divisions followed by asymmetric neurogenic divisions. The division mode of these self-renewing progenitors, together with the cell fate of their progeny, plays critical roles in determining the number of neurons and, ultimately, the size of the adult brain. In the past decade, remarkable progress has been made toward identifying various types of neuronal progenitors. Recent technological advances in live imaging and genetic manipulation have enabled us to link dynamic cell biological events to the molecular mechanisms that control the asymmetric divisions of self-renewing progenitors and have provided a fresh perspective on the modes of division of these progenitors. In addition, comparison of progenitor repertoires between species has provided insight into the expansion and the development of the complexity of the brain during mammalian evolution.},
