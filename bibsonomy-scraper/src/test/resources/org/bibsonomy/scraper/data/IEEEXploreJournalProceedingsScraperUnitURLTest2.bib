  abstract={Providing point-to-point messaging-passing semantics atop Put/Get hardware traditionally involves implementing a protocol comprising three network latencies. In this paper, we analyze the performance of an alternative implementation approach - receiver-initiated message passing - that eliminates one of the three network latencies. Performance measurements taken on the Cell Broadband Engine indicate that receiver-initiated message passing exhibits substantially lower latency than standard, sender-initiated message passing.},
