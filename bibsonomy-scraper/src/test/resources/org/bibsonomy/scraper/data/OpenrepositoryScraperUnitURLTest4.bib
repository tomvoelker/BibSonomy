abstract={A master-equation approach is used to perform dynamic modeling of phase-transformation processes that define the operating regimes and performance attributes of electronic (and optical) processors and multistate memory devices based on phase-change materials. The predictions of the so-called energy accumulation and direct-overwrite regimes, prerequisites for processing and memory functions, respectively, emerge in detail from the model, providing a theoretical framework for future device design and evaluation.},
