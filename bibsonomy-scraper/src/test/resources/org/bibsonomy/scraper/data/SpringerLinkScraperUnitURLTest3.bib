abstract={In this paper, we combine sampling technique with DBSCAN algorithm to cluster large spatial databases, two sampling-basedDBSCAN (SDBSCAN) algorithms are developed. One algorithm introduces sampling technique inside DBSCAN; and the other uses samplingprocedure outside DBSCAN. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithms are effective and efficient in clustering large-scalespatial databases.},
