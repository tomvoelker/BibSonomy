   abstract = {In this paper, we combine sampling technique with DBSCAN algorithm to cluster large spatial databases, two sampling-based DBSCAN (SDBSCAN) algorithms are developed. One algorithm introduces sampling technique inside DBSCAN; and the other uses sampling procedure outside DBSCAN. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithms are effective and efficient in clustering large-scale spatial databases.},
