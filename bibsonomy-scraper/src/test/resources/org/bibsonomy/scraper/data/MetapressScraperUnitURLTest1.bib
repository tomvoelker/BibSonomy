abstract={Image classification and clustering is a challenging problem in computer vision. This paper proposed a kind of particle swarm
optimization clustering approach: FPSOC to process image clustering problem. This approach considers each particle as a candidatecluster center. The particles fly in the solution space to search suitable cluster centers. This method is different fromprevious work in that it employs fuzzy concept in particle swarm optimization clustering and adopts attribute selection mechanismto avoid the ‘curse of dimensionality’ problem. The experimental results show that the presented approach can properly processimage clustering problem.},
