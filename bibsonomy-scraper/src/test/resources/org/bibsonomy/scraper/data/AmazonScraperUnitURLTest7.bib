abstract = {"Text Mining presents a comprehensive introduction and overview of the field, integrating related topics (such as artificial intelligence and knowledge discovery and data mining) and providing practical advice on how readers can use text-mining methods to analyze their own data. Emphasizing predictive methods, the book unifies all key areas in text mining: preprocessing, text categorization, information search and retrieval, clustering of documents, and information extraction. In addition, it identifies emerging directions for those looking to do research in the area. Some background in data mining is beneficial, but not essential.". "This authoritative and highly accessible text, written by a team of authorities on text mining, develops the foundation concepts, principles, and methods needed to expand beyond structured, numeric data to automated mining of text samples. Researchers, professionals, and advanced undergraduates and graduates with work and interests in data mining, machine learning, databases, and computational linguistics will find the work an essential resource."--BOOK JACKET.},
