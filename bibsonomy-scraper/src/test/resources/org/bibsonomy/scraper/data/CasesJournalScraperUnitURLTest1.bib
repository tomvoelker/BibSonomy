ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND:Esophageal perforation is a serious condition with a high mortality rate. Successful therapy depends on the size of the rupture; the time elapsed between rupture and diagnosis, and the underlying health of the patient. Common causes of esophageal perforation include medical instrumentation, foreign-body ingestion, and trauma.CASE REPORT:A case of esophageal perforation due to fish bone ingestion in a 67-year-old male is described here, with a review of the pertinent literature. The patient presented with chest pain, fever and right-sided pleural effusion. Initial evaluation was nondiagnostic. The water-soluble contrast swallow test showed no evidence of leakage. Computed tomography scan demonstrated a pneumomediastinum, and right-sided hydropneumothorax.CONCLUSION:The patient was successfully treated using conservative measures.},
