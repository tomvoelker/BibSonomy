abstract = {Genomic clustering of genes in a pathway is commonly found in prokaryotes due to transcriptional operons _CMM_ but these are not present in most eukaryotes _PRD_ Yet _CMM_ there might be clustering to a lesser extent of pathway members in eukaryotic genomes _CMM_ that assist coregulation of a set of functionally cooperating genes _PRD_ We analyzed five sequenced eukaryotic genomes for clustering of genes assigned to the same pathway in the KEGG database _PRD_ Between 98 _PCT_ and 30 _PCT_ of the analyzed pathways in a genome were found to exhibit significantly higher clustering levels than expected by chance _PRD_ in descending order by the level of clustering _CMM_ the genomes studied were Saccharomyces cerevisiae _CMM_ Homo sapiens _CMM_ Caenorhabditis elegans _CMM_ Arabidopsis thaliana _CMM_ and Drosophila melanogaster _PRD_ Surprisingly _CMM_ there is not much agreement between genomes in terms of which pathways are most clustered _PRD_ Only seven of 69 pathways found in all species were significantly clustered in all five of them _PRD_ This species-specific pattern of pathway clustering may reflect adaptations or evolutionary events unique to a particular lineage _PRD_ We note that although operons are common in C elegans _CMM_ only 58 _PCT_ of the pathways showed significant clustering _CMM_ which is less than in human _PRD_ Virtually all pathways in S cerevisiae showed significant },
