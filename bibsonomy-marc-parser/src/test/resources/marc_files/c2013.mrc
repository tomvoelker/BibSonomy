The security of these cryptosystems relies heavily on these three infeasible problems, as no polynomial-time algorithms exist for them so far. However, polynomial-time quantum algorithms for IFP, DLP and ECDLP do exist, provided that a practical quantum computer exists.Quantum Attacks on Public-Key Cryptosystems presemts almost all known quantum computing based attacks on public-key cryptosystems, with an emphasis on quantum algorithms for IFP, DLP, and ECDLP. It also discusses some quantum resistant cryptosystems to replace the IFP, DLP and ECDLP based cryptosystems.This book is intended to be used either as a graduate text in computing, communications and mathematics, or as a basic reference in the field. 0aComputer science. 0aComputer Communication Networks. 0aData structures (Computer science). 0aData encryption (Computer science). 0aComputer software. 0aAlgebraxData processing.14aComputer Science.24aData Structures, Cryptology and Information Theory.24aData Encryption.24aAlgorithm Analysis and Problem Complexity.24aMathematics of Computing.24aSymbolic and Algebraic Manipulation.24aComputer Communication Networks.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer eBooks08iPrinted edition:z978144197721240uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4419-7722-9  aZDB-2-SCS  aComputer Science (Springer-11645)04012nam a22005175i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001500172050001500187072001700202072002300219082001600242082001400258100002000272245013600292260005900428300003700487490005400524505126100578520101601839650002202855650002602877650002502903650001502928650002202943650005202965650004303017650002903060650005103089650002403140650002703164700001903191700002203210700001803232710003403250773002003284776003603304830005403340856004803394912001403442950003803456978-1-4471-2990-5DE-He21320130321101806.0cr nn 008mamaa130321s2013    xxk|    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97814471299059978-1-4471-2990-57 a10.1007/978-1-4471-2990-52doi 4aQA76.9.U83 4aQA76.9.H85 7aUYZG2bicssc 7aCOM0700002bisacsh04a005.43722304a4.0192231 aHolland, Simon.10aMusic and Human-Computer Interactionh[electronic resource] /cedited by Simon Holland, Katie Wilkie, Paul Mulholland, Allan Seago.  aLondon :bSpringer London :bImprint: Springer,c2013.  aVIII, 292 p. 60 illus.bdigital.0 aSpringer Series on Cultural Computing,x2195-90560 aMusic Interaction: Understanding Music and Human-Computer Interaction -- Should Music Interaction Be Easy? -- Amateur Musicians, Long-term Engagement, and HCI -- Affective Musical Interaction: Influencing Users’ Behaviour and Experiences with Music -- Chasing a Feeling: Experience in Computer Support Jamming -- The Haptic Bracelets: Learning Multi-limb Rhythm Skills from Haptic Stimuli whilst Reading -- Piano Technique as a Case Study in Expressive Gestural Interaction -- Live Music-making: A Rich Open Task Requires a Rich Open Interface -- A New Interaction Strategy for Musical Timbre Design -- Pulsed Melodic Processing – The Use of Melodies in Affective Computations for Increased Processing Transparency -- Computer Musicking: HCI, CSCW, and Collaborative Digital Musical Interaction -- Song Walker Harmony Space: Embodied Interaction Design for Complex Musical Skills -- Evolutionary and Generative Music Informs Music HCI – and vice versa -- Video Analysis for Evaluating Music Interaction: Musical Tabletops -- Towards a Participatory Approach for Interaction Design based on Conceptual Metaphor Theory: A Case Study from Music Interaction -- Appropriate and Complementary Rhythmic Improvisation in an Interactive Music System -- Index.  aThis agenda-setting book presents state of the art research in Music and Human-Computer Interaction (also known as ‘Music Interaction’).

Whether we are bridging time or distance, and whether we are enhancing our closest relationships or strengthening the bonds of extended family, as computer technologies alter the communication landscape, they in turn are changing the way we conduct and experience family life.This state of the art volume explores the impact of new communication systems on how families interact – how they share their lives and routines, engage in social touch, and negotiate being together or being apart – by considering a range of different family relationships that shape the nature of communication. Composed of three sections, the first looks at what is often the core of a ‘family’, the couple, to understand the impact of technology on couple relationships, communication, and feelings of closeness. The second section studies immediate families that have expanded beyond just the individual or couple to include children. Here, the emphasis is on connection for communication, coordination, and play. The third section moves beyond the immediate family to explore connections between extended, distributed family members. This includes connections between adult children and their parents, grandparents and grandchildren, and adult siblings. Here family members have grown older, moved away from ‘home’, and forged new families.Researchers, designers and developers of new communication technologies will find this volume invaluable. Connecting Families: The Impact of New Communication Technologies on Domestic Life brings together the most up-to-date studies to help in understanding how new communication technologies shape – and are shaped by – family life, and offers inspiration and guidance for design by making clear what families need and value from technological systems. 0aComputer science. 0aSoftware engineering.14aComputer Science.24aComputers and Society.24aSoftware Engineering.24aUser Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction.1 aHarrison, Steve.1 aSellen, Abigail.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer eBooks08iPrinted edition:z978144714191440uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4471-4192-1  aZDB-2-SCS  aComputer Science (Springer-11645)03989nam a22003975i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001100172050001400183072001700197072002300214082001400237100001900251245010100270260005900371300005800430490006800488505078600556520186801342650002203210650003303232650002203265650002503287700002103312710003403333773002003367776003603387830006803423856004803491912001403539950003803553978-1-4471-4402-1DE-He21320130217115342.0cr nn 008mamaa130125s2013    xxk|    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97814471440219978-1-4471-4402-17 a10.1007/978-1-4471-4402-12doi 4aQ337.5 4aTK7882.P3 7aUYQP2bicssc 7aCOM0160002bisacsh04a006.42231 aBurge, Mark J.10aHandbook of Iris Recognitionh[electronic resource] /cedited by Mark J.

Assistive technologies, adaptive systems and context-aware applications are three well-established research fields. There is, in fact, a vast amount of literature that covers HCI-related issues in each area separately. However, the contributions in the intersection of these areas have been less visible, despite the fact that such synergies may have a great impact on improving daily living.Presenting a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art practices on user modeling and adaptation for people with special needs, as well as some reflections on the challenges that need to be addressed in this direction, topics covered within this volume include the analysis, design, implementation and evaluation of adaptive systems to assist users with special needs to take decisions and fulfil daily routine activities. Particular emphasis is paid to major trends in user modeling, ubiquitous adaptive support, diagnostic and accessibility, recommender systems, social interaction, designing and building adaptive assistants for daily routines, field studies and automated evaluation.Nine leading contributors write on key current research in the domain of adaptive applications for people with special needs, integrating and summarizing findings from the best known international research groups in these areas. User Modeling and Adaptation for Daily Routines highlights how adaptation technologies can ease daily living for all, and support sustainable high-quality healthcare, demographic ageing and social/economic inclusion. 0aComputer science. 0aArtificial intelligence. 0aSocial sciencesxData processing.14aComputer Science.24aComputer Appl. in Social and Behavioral Sciences.24aUser Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction.24aArtificial Intelligence (incl.

For instance, a user’s focus of attention is useful in interpreting the user’s intentions, their understanding of the conversation, and their attitude towards the conversation. In human face-to-face communication, eye gaze plays an important role in floor management, grounding, and engagement in conversation.Eye Gaze in Intelligent User Interfaces draws on ideas from a number of contributors working on how attentional information can be applied to novel intelligent interfaces. Part I focuses on analyzing human eye gaze behaviors to reveal characteristics of human communication and cognition; Part II addresses estimation and prediction of the cognitive state of the users using gaze information; and Part III presents proposals of novel gaze-aware interfaces which integrate eye-trackers as a system component. The contributions highlight a direction for the future of human-computer interaction, and discuss issues in human attentional behaviors and face-to-face communication which are essential in designing gaze aware interactive interfaces. 0aComputer science. 0aMultimedia systems. 0aComputer vision. 0aSocial sciencesxData processing. 0aEducation.14aComputer Science.24aUser Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction.24aComputer Appl. in Social and Behavioral Sciences.24aComputers and Education.24aComputer Imaging, Vision, Pattern Recognition and Graphics.24aMultimedia Information Systems.1 aConati, Cristina.1 aBader, Thomas.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer eBooks08iPrinted edition:z978144714783140uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4471-4784-8  aZDB-2-SCS  aComputer Science (Springer-11645)03631nam a22004935i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001500172050001500187072001700202072002300219082001600242082001400258100002700272245013400299260005900433300003600492490006000528505037300588520160800961650002202569650001502591650001502606650002602621650002602647650002202673650005202695650001802747650002502765650004302790650001502833650003902848710003402887773002002921776003602941830006002977856004803037912001403085950003803099978-1-4471-4841-8DE-He21320130217124305.0cr nn 008mamaa130107s2013    xxk|    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97814471484189978-1-4471-4841-87 a10.1007/978-1-4471-4841-82doi 4aQA76.9.U83 4aQA76.9.H85 7aUYZG2bicssc 7aCOM0700002bisacsh04a005.43722304a4.0192231 aWiertlewski, Michaël.10aReproduction of Tactual Texturesh[electronic resource] :bTransducers, Mechanics and Signal Encoding /cby Michaël Wiertlewski.  aLondon :bSpringer London :bImprint: Springer,c2013.  aXIV, 133 p. 52 illus.bdigital.0 aSpringer Series on Touch and Haptic Systems,x2192-29770 aForeword -- Introduction -- Literature Review -- Causality Inversion in the Reproduction of Roughness -- The Spatial Spectrum of Tangential Skin Displacement -- Transducer for Mechanical Impedance Testing Over a Wide Frequency Range -- Mechanical Behavior of the Fingertip in Lateral Traction -- Vibrations of a Finger Sliding on Flat and Wavy Surfaces -- Conclusions.  aTexture accounts for an important part of the realism of simulated experiences, and it is most certainly true during tactile interaction. We usually experience roughness by running our fingers onto the explored surface. The perception of this fine texture is mediated by the vibrations generated by the encounters of the skin and the asperities of the surfaces.Reproduction of Tactual Textures presents factors that contribute to the mechanics of the interaction between a bare finger and a surface with a view to their artificial reproduction. It discusses the recording and reproduction of tactual textures, and analyses a case study of the development of a device able to record the vibratory signal from a fingertip sliding over a textured surface. The same device is then used in a reverse way to render those previously measured signals to the user’s fingertip. These developments open new questions about the biomechanical properties of the skin and their relation to perception. The second half of Reproduction of Tactual Textures focuses on the implication of the dynamic parameters of the skin onto rendering performance, and it concludes with a study on the important features that are present in the vibratory signal and their relation to texture perception.This state-of-the-art volume highlights the importance of the mechanics and biomechanics during the haptic exploration of surfaces and their possible contribution to perception. Collectively, the findings reported are pertinent to many applications, including robotic perception and the design of effective virtual reality systems. 0aComputer science. 0aAcoustics. 0aVibration. 0aPhilosophy (General). 0aChemistry, inorganic.14aComputer Science.24aUser Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction.24aMechatronics.24aPsychology, general.24aVibration, Dynamical Systems, Control.24aAcoustics.24aTribology, Corrosion and Coatings.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer eBooks08iPrinted edition:z9781447148401 0aSpringer Series on Touch and Haptic Systems,x2192-297740uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4471-4841-8  aZDB-2-SCS  aComputer Science (Springer-11645)05004nam a22004455i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001600172072001600188072001700204072002300221082001400244100001900258245018000277260005900457300003600516490006200552505168300614520175102297650002204048650001704070650003604087650002204123650005504145650003404200650003304234700001904267700002004286710003404306773002004340776003604360830006204396856004804458912001404506950003804520978-1-4471-4866-1DE-He21320130217124323.0cr nn 008mamaa130217s2013    xxk|    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97814471486619978-1-4471-4866-17 a10.1007/978-1-4471-4866-12doi 4aQA76.76.A65 7aUNH2bicssc 7aUDBD2bicssc 7aCOM0320002bisacsh04a005.72231 aRausch, Peter.10aBusiness Intelligence and Performance Managementh[electronic resource] :bTheory, Systems and Industrial Applications /cedited by Peter Rausch, Alaa F.

Companies operate in a world of change influenced by globalisation, volatile markets, legal changes and technical progress. As a result, they have to handle growing volumes of data and therefore require fast storage, reliable data access, intelligent retrieval of information and automated decision-making mechanisms, all provided at the highest level of service quality. Successful enterprises are aware of these challenges and efficiently respond to the dynamic environment in which their business operates.Business Intelligence (BI) and Performance Management (PM) offer solutions to these challenges and provide techniques to enable effective business change. The important aspects of both topics are discussed within this state-of-the-art volume. It covers the strategic support, business applications, methodologies and technologies from the field, and explores the benefits, issues and challenges of each. Issues are analysed from many different perspectives, ranging from strategic management to data technologies, and the different subjects are complimented and illustrated by numerous examples of industrial applications. Contributions are authored by leading academics and practitioners representing various universities, research centres and companies worldwide. Their experience covers multiple disciplines and industries, including finance, construction, logistics, and public services, amongst others.Business Intelligence and Performance Management is a valuable source of reference for graduates approaching MSc or PhD programs and for professionals in industry researching in the fields of BI and PM for industrial application. 0aComputer science. 0aMathematics. 0aManagement information systems.14aComputer Science.24aInformation Systems Applications (incl.

Consequently, the analysis of Big Data is nowadays a central challenge in Computer Science, especially for complex data. For example, given a satellite image database containing tens of Terabytes, how can we find regions aiming at identifying native rainforests, deforestation or reforestation? Can it be made automatically? Based on the work discussed in this book, the answers to both questions are a sound “yes”, and the results can be obtained in just minutes. In fact, results that used to require days or weeks of hard work from human specialists can now be obtained in minutes with high precision. Data Mining in Large Sets of Complex Data discusses new algorithms that take steps forward from traditional data mining (especially for clustering) by considering large, complex datasets. Usually, other works focus in one aspect, either data size or complexity. This work considers both: it enables mining complex data from high impact applications, such as breast cancer diagnosis, region classification in satellite images, assistance to climate change forecast, recommendation systems for the Web and social networks; the data are large in the Terabyte-scale, not in Giga as usual; and very accurate results are found in just minutes. Thus, it provides a crucial and well timed contribution for allowing the creation of real time applications that deal with Big Data of high complexity in which mining on the fly can make an immeasurable difference, such as supporting cancer diagnosis or detecting deforestation. 0aComputer science. 0aDatabase management. 0aData mining.14aComputer Science.24aData Mining and Knowledge Discovery.24aDatabase Management.1 aFaloutsos, Christos.1 aTraina Júnior, Caetano.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer eBooks08iPrinted edition:z9781447148890 0aSpringerBriefs in Computer Science,x2191-576840uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4471-4890-6  aZDB-2-SCS  aComputer Science (Springer-11645)03805nam a22004815i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001600172050001600188072001600204072001700220072002300237072002300260082001400283082001500297100002000312245015000332260005900482300006000541490006800601505031900669520184700988650002202835650002302857650002102880650003302901650002202934650004202956650002502998650002303023700001903046710003403065773002003099776003603119830006803155856004803223912001403271950003803285978-1-4471-4902-6DE-He21320130217124400.0cr nn 008mamaa130125s2013    xxk|    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97814471490269978-1-4471-4902-67 a10.1007/978-1-4471-4902-62doi 4aTA1637-1638 4aTA1637-1638 7aUYT2bicssc 7aUYQV2bicssc 7aCOM0120002bisacsh 7aCOM0160002bisacsh04a006.622304a006.372231 aHaindl, Michal.10aVisual Textureh[electronic resource] :bAccurate Material Appearance Measurement, Representation and Modeling /cby Michal Haindl, Jiří Filip.  aLondon :bSpringer London :bImprint: Springer,c2013.  aXXXI, 284 p. 158 illus., 148 illus. in color.bdigital.0 aAdvances in Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,x2191-65860 aMotivation -- Representation -- Texture Acquisition -- Static Multispectral Textures -- Dynamic Textures -- Spatially-Varying Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Functions -- Bidirectional Texture Functions -- Visualization -- Perceptual Validation and Analysis -- Applications -- Conclusions and Open Problems.  aAlthough the field of texture processing is now well-established, research in this area remains predominantly restricted to texture analysis and simple and approximate static textures.This comprehensive text/reference presents a survey of the state of the art in multidimensional, physically-correct visual texture modeling.

In contrast to the Fourier transform-based approaches where a fixed window is used uniformly for a range of frequencies, the wavelet transform uses short windows at high frequencies and long windows at low frequencies. This way, the characteristics of non-stationary disturbances can be more closely monitored. In other words, both time and frequency information can be obtained by wavelet transform. Instead of transforming a pure time description into a pure frequency description, the wavelet transform finds a good promise in a time-frequency description. Due to its inherent time-scale locality characteristics, the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) has received considerable attention in digital signal processing (speech and image processing), communication, computer science and mathematics. Wavelet transforms are known to have excellent energy compaction characteristics and are able to provide perfect reconstruction. Therefore, they are ideal for signal/image processing. The shifting (or translation) and scaling (or dilation) are unique to wavelets. Orthogonality of wavelets with respect to dilations leads to multigrid representation. The nature of wavelet computation forces us to carefully examine the implementation methodologies. As the computation of DWT involves filtering, an efficient filtering process is essential in DWT hardware implementation. In the multistage DWT, coefficients are calculated recursively, and in addition to the wavelet decomposition stage, extra space is required to store the intermediate coefficients. Hence, the overall performance depends significantly on the precision of the intermediate DWT coefficients.This work presents new implementation techniques of DWT, that are efficient in terms of computation requirement, storage requirement, and with better signal-to-noise ratio in the reconstructed signal. 0aComputer science. 0aComputer software. 0aComputer vision.14aComputer Science.24aImage Processing and Computer Vision.24aSignal, Image and Speech Processing.24aAlgorithm Analysis and Problem Complexity.1 aTiwari, Arvind K.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer eBooks08iPrinted edition:z9781447149408 0aSpringerBriefs in Computer Science,x2191-576840uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4471-4941-5  aZDB-2-SCS  aComputer Science (Springer-11645)02900nam a22004695i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001600172050001600188072001600204072001700220072002300237072002300260082001400283082001500297100001600312245014400328260005900472300005600531490005100587505040300638520091801041650002201959650002901981650002102010650002202031650004202053650004602095650002902141700001902170710003402189773002002223776003602243830005102279856004802330912001402378950003802392978-1-4471-4947-7DE-He21320130217124835.0cr nn 008mamaa130202s2013    xxk|    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97814471494779978-1-4471-4947-77 a10.1007/978-1-4471-4947-72doi 4aTA1637-1638 4aTA1637-1638 7aUYT2bicssc 7aUYQV2bicssc 7aCOM0120002bisacsh 7aCOM0160002bisacsh04a006.622304a006.372231 aPuig, Luis.10aOmnidirectional Vision Systemsh[electronic resource] :bCalibration, Feature Extraction and 3D Information /cby Luis Puig, J.J.

The book opens with a thorough introduction to the sphere camera model, along with an analysis of the relation between this model and actual central catadioptric systems. Then, a new approach to calibrate any single-viewpoint catadioptric camera is described.  This is followed by an analysis of existing methods for calibrating central omnivision systems, and a detailed examination of hybrid two-view relations that combine images acquired with uncalibrated central catadioptric systems and conventional cameras. In the remaining chapters, the book discusses a new method to compute the scale space of any omnidirectional image acquired with a central catadioptric system, and a technique for computing the orientation of a hand-held omnidirectional catadioptric camera. 0aComputer science. 0aArtificial intelligence. 0aComputer vision.14aComputer Science.24aImage Processing and Computer Vision.24aArtificial Intelligence (incl.

Traditionally, economic modeling has been modeled in the linear domain where the principles of superposition are valid. The application of artificial intelligence for economic modeling allows for a flexible multi-order non-linear modeling. In addition, game theory has largely been applied in economic modeling. However, the inherent limitation of game theory when dealing with many player games encourages the use of multi-agent systems for modeling economic phenomena.The artificial intelligence techniques used to model economic data include:multi-layer perceptron neural networksradial basis functionssupport vector machinesrough setsgenetic algorithmparticle swarm optimizationsimulated annealingmulti-agent systemincremental learningfuzzy networksSignal processing techniques are explored to analyze economic data, and these techniques are the time domain methods, time-frequency domain methods and fractals dimension approaches. Interesting economic problems such as causality versus correlation, simulating the stock market, modeling and controling inflation, option pricing, modeling economic growth as well as portfolio optimization are examined. The relationship between economic dependency and interstate conflict is explored, and knowledge on how economics is useful to foster peace – and vice versa – is investigated. Economic Modeling Using Artificial Intelligence Methods deals with the issue of causality in the non-linear domain and applies the automatic relevance determination, the evidence framework, Bayesian approach and Granger causality to understand causality and correlation.Economic Modeling Using Artificial Intelligence Methods makes an important contribution to the area of econometrics, and is a valuable source of reference for graduate students, researchers and financial practitioners. 0aComputer science. 0aArtificial intelligence. 0aOptical pattern recognition. 0aMathematical statistics. 0aEngineering. 0aEconomics, Mathematical.14aComputer Science.24aArtificial Intelligence (incl.

When teaching algorithms, the teacher's main goal should be to convey the underlying ideas and to help the students form correct mental models related to the algorithm. This process can often be facilitated by using suitable metaphors. This work provides a set of novel metaphors identified and developed as suitable tools for teaching many of the "classic textbook" algorithms taught in undergraduate courses worldwide. Each chapter provides exercises and didactic notes for teachers based on the authors’ experiences when using the metaphor in a classroom setting. 0aComputer science. 0aEducation. 0aSciencexStudy and teaching.14aComputer Science.24aComputers and Education.24aScience Education.1 aSteinová, Monika.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer eBooks08iPrinted edition:z9781447150183 0aSpringerBriefs in Computer Science,x2191-576840uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4471-5019-0  aZDB-2-SCS  aComputer Science (Springer-11645)02474nam a22003855i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001200172072001400184072001600198072002300214082001500237100002400252245009800276260006100374300003500435505021000470520099600680650002201676650001701698650002201715650002601737650008001763650005501843710003401898773002001932776003601952856004801988912001402036950003802050978-1-4471-5025-1DE-He21320130411043920.0cr nn 008mamaa130411s2013    xxk|    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97814471502519978-1-4471-5025-17 a10.1007/978-1-4471-5025-12doi 4aQA76.17 7aU2bicssc 7aTBX2bicssc 7aCOM0800002bisacsh04a004.092231 aCarpenter, Brian E.10aNetwork Geeksh[electronic resource] :bHow They Built the Internet /cby Brian E.

Yet some questioned “why anyone would want such a thing” when the idea was first introduced.Part history, part memoir and part cultural study, Network Geeks charts the creation of the Internet and the establishment of the Internet Engineering Task Force, from the viewpoint of a self-proclaimed geek who witnessed these developments first-hand. With boundless enthusiasm and abundant humour, Brian Carpenter leads the reader on a journey from post-war Britain to post-millennium New Zealand, describing how the Internet grew into today’s ubiquitous, global network, including the genesis of the World-Wide Web in the hotbeds of a particle collider at CERN. Illuminating the science and technology behind the apparent “magic trick” of the Internet, Network Geeks opens a window into the initially bewildering world of the Internet engineering geek.

Such command and control must be quick, effective, and considerate when dealing with the changing, complex, and risky conditions of the situation. To enable optimal command and control under extremes, robust structures and efficient operations are required of organizations. This work discusses how to design and conduct virtual experiments on resilient organizational structures and operational practices using modeling and simulation. The work illustrates key aspects of robustly networked organizations and modeled performance of human decision-makers through examples of naval-air defense, counterterrorism operations, and disaster responses. 0aComputer science. 0aComputer simulation.14aComputer Science.24aSimulation and Modeling.1 aCarley, Kathleen M.1 aKim, Tag Gon.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer eBooks08iPrinted edition:z9781447150367 0aSpringerBriefs in Computer Science,x2191-576840uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4471-5037-4  aZDB-2-SCS  aComputer Science (Springer-11645)03443nam a22004575i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001300172050002000185072001600205072001800221072002300239082001400262100002000276245016500296260005900461300003600520490005100556505027100607520160600878650002202484650002902506650001902535650002202554650004602576650005102622650001302673700003302686700002502719710003402744773002002778776003602798830005102834856004802885912001402933950003802947978-1-4471-5046-6DE-He21320130322102314.0cr nn 008mamaa130322s2013    xxk|    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97814471504669978-1-4471-5046-67 a10.1007/978-1-4471-5046-62doi 4aQ334-342 4aTJ210.2-211.495 7aUYQ2bicssc 7aTJFM12bicssc 7aCOM0040002bisacsh04a006.32231 aPotiron, Katia.10aFrom Fault Classification to Fault Tolerance for Multi-Agent Systemsh[electronic resource] /cby Katia Potiron, Amal El Fallah Seghrouchni, Patrick Taillibert.  aLondon :bSpringer London :bImprint: Springer,c2013.  aVIII, 80 p. 19 illus.bdigital.0 aSpringerBriefs in Computer Science,x2191-57680 aPreface -- Introduction -- Multi-Agent System Properties -- Fault Classification -- Refinement of the Fault Classification for MAS -- Fault Tolerance for MAS Specific Faults -- Fault Classification Attributes as an Ontology to Build Fault Tolerant MAS -- Conclusion.  aFaults are a concern for Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) designers, especially if the MAS are built for industrial or military use because there must be some guarantee of dependability. Some fault classification exists for classical systems, and is used to define faults. When dependability is at stake, such fault classification may be used from the beginning of the system’s conception to define fault classes and specify which types of faults are expected. Thus, one may want to use fault classification for MAS; however, From Fault Classification to Fault Tolerance for Multi-Agent Systems argues that working with autonomous and proactive agents implies a special analysis of the faults potentially occurring in the system. Moreover, the field of Fault Tolerance (FT) provides numerous methods adapted to handle different kinds of faults. Some handling methods have been studied within the MAS domain, adapting to their specificities and capabilities but increasing the large amount of FT methods. Therefore, unless being an expert in fault tolerance, it is difficult to choose, evaluate or compare fault tolerance methods, preventing a lot of developed applications from not only to being more pleasant to use but, more importantly, from at least being tolerant to common faults. From Fault Classification to Fault Tolerance for Multi-Agent Systems shows that specification phase guidelines and fault handler studies can be derived from the fault classification extension made for MAS. From this perspective, fault classification can become a unifying concept between fault tolerance methods in MAS. 0aComputer science. 0aArtificial intelligence. 0aSystem safety.14aComputer Science.24aArtificial Intelligence (incl.

Conceptually, Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) is basically simple, exemplified in the physical world by the rapid riffling of the pages of a book in order to locate a known image. Advances in computation and graphics processing allow RSVP to be applied flexibly and effectively to a huge variety of common tasks such as window shopping, video fast-forward and rewind, TV channel selection and product browsing. At its heart is a remarkable feature of the human visual processing system known as pre-attentive processing, one which supports the recognition of a known image within as little as one hundred milliseconds and without conscious cognitive effort.Knowledge of pre-attentive processing, together with extensive empirical evidence concerning RSVP, has allowed the authors to provide useful guidance to interaction designers wishing to explore the relevance of RSVP to an application, guidance which is supported by a variety of illustrative examples. 0aComputer science. 0aArchitectural design. 0aVisualization. 0aConsciousness.14aComputer Science.24aUser Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction.24aComputer Applications.24aVisualization.24aCognitive Psychology.24aInteraction Design.1 aWitkowski, Mark.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer eBooks08iPrinted edition:z9781447150848 0aSpringerBriefs in Computer Science,x2191-576840uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4471-5085-5  aZDB-2-SCS  aComputer Science (Springer-11645)02974nam a22004455i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001600172072001600188072001700204072002300221082001600244100002300260245009100283260005900374300005700433505068100490520080001171650002201971650003701993650002502030650001702055650004702072650002202119650004102141650002502182650003902207650003702246650005502283710003402338773002002372776003602392856004802428912001402476950003802490978-1-4614-6309-2DE-He21320130220185735.0cr nn 008mamaa130125s2013    xxu|    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97814614630929978-1-4614-6309-27 a10.1007/978-1-4614-6309-22doi 4aQA76.9.D343 7aUNF2bicssc 7aUYQE2bicssc 7aCOM0210302bisacsh04a006.3122231 aAggarwal, Charu C.10aManaging and Mining Sensor Datah[electronic resource] /cedited by Charu C.

Computer scientists, specifically, approach this field based on their practical experiences in managing large amounts of data, and with far fewer assumptions– the data can be of any type, structured or unstructured, and may be extremely large. Outlier Analysis is a comprehensive exposition, as understood by data mining experts, statisticians and computer scientists. The book has been organized carefully, and emphasis was placed on simplifying the content, so that students and practitioners can also benefit. Chapters will typically cover one of three areas: methods and techniques  commonly used in outlier analysis, such as linear methods, proximity-based methods, subspace methods, and supervised methods; data  domains, such as, text, categorical, mixed-attribute, time-series, streaming, discrete sequence, spatial and network data; and key applications of these methods as applied to diverse domains such as  credit card fraud detection, intrusion detection, medical diagnosis, earth science, web log analytics, and social network analysis are covered. 0aComputer science. 0aData protection. 0aDatabase management. 0aData mining. 0aInformation storage and retrieval systems. 0aArtificial intelligence. 0aMathematical statistics.14aComputer Science.24aData Mining and Knowledge Discovery.24aArtificial Intelligence (incl.

No longer will personal data be shared or stored in the cloud as merely data, encrypted or otherwise; it will now be stored and shared as a constituent of the binary string specifying the entire SmartData agent. This agent proactively builds-in privacy, security and user preferences, right from the outset, not as an afterthought. SmartData: Privacy Meets Evolutionary Robotics includes the advances made in the technology of simulating virtual worlds, together with the ideas emerging from fields of evolutionary robotics and embodied cognition within a framework of dynamical systems as an approach toward this ultimate goal.

A practical approach to building unconditional confidentiality for Wireless Communication security by feedback and error correcting code is introduced and a framework of PHY security based on space time block code (STBC) MIMO system is demonstrated.  Also discussed is a scheme which combines cryptographic techniques implemented in the higher layer with the physical layer security approach using redundant antennas of MIMO systems to provide stronger security for wireless networks. The channel responses between communication peers have been explored as a form of fingerprint with spatial and temporal uniqueness. Finally, the book develops a new lightweight method of channel identification for Sybil attack and node clone detection in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). 0aComputer science. 0aComputer Communication Networks. 0aData protection. 0aTelecommunication.14aComputer Science.24aComputer Communication Networks.24aCommunications Engineering, Networks.24aSystems and Data Security.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer eBooks08iPrinted edition:z9781461465096 0aSpringerBriefs in Computer Science,x2191-576840uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-6510-2  aZDB-2-SCS  aComputer Science (Springer-11645)03166nam a22003975i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001300172072001500185072002300200082001400223100002300237245015100260260006700411300003400478490005100512505022700563520155800790650002202348650002402370650002202394650003602416650005202452700002302504710003402527773002002561776003602581830005102617856004802668912001402716950003802730978-1-4614-6534-8DE-He21320130326041852.0cr nn 008mamaa130326s2013    xxu|    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97814614653489978-1-4614-6534-87 a10.1007/978-1-4614-6534-82doi 4aQA76.575 7aUG2bicssc 7aCOM0340002bisacsh04a006.72231 aKarasulu, Bahadir.10aPerformance Evaluation Softwareh[electronic resource] :bMoving Object Detection and Tracking in Videos /cby Bahadir Karasulu, Serdar Korukoglu.  aNew York, NY :bSpringer New York :bImprint: Springer,c2013.  aXV, 76 p. 11 illus.bdigital.0 aSpringerBriefs in Computer Science,x2191-57680 aIntroduction -- Moving Object Detection and Tracking in Videos -- A Software Approach to Performance Evaluation -- Performance Measures and Evaluation -- A Case Study: People Detection and Tracking in Videos -- Conclusion.  aPerformance Evaluation Software: Moving Object Detection and Tracking in Videos introduces a software approach for the real-time evaluation and performance comparison of the methods specializing in moving object detection and/or tracking (D&amp;T) in video processing. Digital video content analysis is an important item for multimedia content-based indexing (MCBI), content-based video retrieval (CBVR) and visual surveillance systems. There are some frequently-used generic algorithms for video object D&amp;T in the literature, such as Background Subtraction (BS), Continuously Adaptive Mean-shift (CMS), Optical Flow (OF), etc. An important problem for performance evaluation is the absence of any stable and flexible software for comparison of different algorithms. In this frame, we have designed and implemented the software for comparing and evaluating the well-known video object D&amp;T algorithms on the same platform. This software is able to compare them with the same metrics in real-time and on the same platform. It also works as an automatic and/or semi-automatic test environment in real-time, which uses the image and video processing essentials, e.g. morphological operations and filters, and ground-truth (GT) XML data files, charting/plotting capabilities, etc. Along with the comprehensive literature survey of the abovementioned video object D&amp;T algorithms, this book also covers the technical details of our performance benchmark software as well as a case study on people D&amp;T for the functionality of the software. 0aComputer science. 0aMultimedia systems.14aComputer Science.24aMultimedia Information Systems.24aUser Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction.1 aKorukoglu, Serdar.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer eBooks08iPrinted edition:z9781461465331 0aSpringerBriefs in Computer Science,x2191-576840uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-6534-8  aZDB-2-SCS  aComputer Science (Springer-11645)02781nam a22004095i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050002000172072001600192072002300208082001400231100001600245245011400261260006700375300003600442490005100478505027000529520112800799650002201927650003701949650002301986650002202009650003702031650004202068700002002110710003402130773002002164776003602184830005102220856004802271912001402319950003802333978-1-4614-6602-4DE-He21320130323084803.0cr nn 008mamaa130323s2013    xxu|    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97814614660249978-1-4614-6602-47 a10.1007/978-1-4614-6602-42doi 4aTK5105.5-5105.9 7aUKN2bicssc 7aCOM0750002bisacsh04a004.62231 aWang, Ping.10aDistributed Medium Access Control in Wireless Networksh[electronic resource] /cby Ping Wang, Weihua Zhuang.  aNew York, NY :bSpringer New York :bImprint: Springer,c2013.  aXII, 109 p. 42 illus.bdigital.0 aSpringerBriefs in Computer Science,x2191-57680 aIntroduction -- Literature Review and Background -- Voice Capacity Improvement over Infrastructure WLANs -- Service Differentiation over Ad Hoc WLANs -- Dual Busy-tone MAC for Wireless Ad Hoc Networks -- Collision-free MAC forWireless Mesh Backbones -- Conclusions.  aThis brief investigates distributed medium access control (MAC) with QoS provisioning for both single- and multi-hop wireless networks including wireless local area networks (WLANs), wireless ad hoc networks, and wireless mesh networks. For WLANs, an efficient MAC scheme and a call admission control algorithm are presented to provide guaranteed QoS for voice traffic and, at the same time, increase the voice capacity significantly compared with the current WLAN standard. In addition, a novel token-based scheduling scheme is proposed to provide great flexibility and facility to the network service provider for service class management.Also proposed is a novel busy-tone based distributed MAC scheme for wireless ad hoc networks and a collision-free MAC scheme for wireless mesh networks, respectively, taking the different network characteristics into consideration. The proposed schemes enhance the QoS provisioning capability to real-time traffic and, at the same time, significantly improve the system throughput and fairness performance for data traffic, as compared with the most popular IEEE 802.11 MAC scheme. 0aComputer science. 0aComputer Communication Networks. 0aTelecommunication.14aComputer Science.24aComputer Communication Networks.24aCommunications Engineering, Networks.1 aZhuang, Weihua.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer eBooks08iPrinted edition:z9781461466017 0aSpringerBriefs in Computer Science,x2191-576840uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-6602-4  aZDB-2-SCS  aComputer Science (Springer-11645)02761nam a22005175i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001300172050002000185072001600205072001800221072002300239082001400262100002800276245015900304260006700463300002500530490005100555505020100606520080200807650002201609650001801631650002501649650001701674650002901691650002201720650004601742650002501788650003701813650004101850650004501891700002401936700002301960700001901983710003402002773002002036776003602056830005102092856004802143912001402191950003802205978-1-4614-6750-2DE-He21320130321195715.0cr nn 008mamaa130321s2013    xxu|    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97814614675029978-1-4614-6750-27 a10.1007/978-1-4614-6750-22doi 4aQ334-342 4aTJ210.2-211.495 7aUYQ2bicssc 7aTJFM12bicssc 7aCOM0040002bisacsh04a006.32231 aMartinez, Maria Vanina.12aA General Framework for Reasoning On Inconsistencyh[electronic resource] /cby Maria Vanina Martinez, Cristian Molinaro, V.S.

This empowers users to resolve inconsistency in data leveraging both their detailed knowledge of the data as well as their application needs. The brief shows that the framework is well-suited to handle inconsistency in several logics, and provides algorithms to compute preferred options. Finally, the brief shows that the framework not only captures several existing works, but also supports reasoning about inconsistency in several logics for which no such methods exist today. 0aComputer science. 0aLogic design. 0aDatabase management. 0aData mining. 0aArtificial intelligence.14aComputer Science.24aArtificial Intelligence (incl.

Semantic descriptions for geospatial data, services, and geoprocessing service chains are structured, organized, and registered in geospatial catalogue services. The ontology-based approach helps to improve the recall and precision of data and services discovery. Semantics-enabled metadata tracking and satisfaction allows analysts to focus on the generation of a geospatial process model rather than spending large amounts of time in data preparation. “DataType”-driven service composition and path planning can help to automate a range of knowledge discovery processes in a limited geospatial domain. Process planning facilitates the construction of complex services and models for geocomputation. A three-phase procedure to cover the lifecycle of service chaining and to identify the roles of the methods involved is proposed. It includes process modeling, process model instantiation, and workflow execution. The approach is implemented in a prototype system with use cases to demonstrate applicability. The objective of the research is to develop the key technologies for an intelligent geospatial knowledge system based on Web services to automate the data discovery and data preprocessing steps in the distributed Web service environment, to automate a range of knowledge discovery processes in a limited geospatial domain, using the automated construction and execution of service chains, and to facilitate the construction of complex services and models for geocomputation. 0aComputer science. 0aComputer network architectures. 0aInformation systems. 0aArtificial intelligence. 0aComputer vision. 0aGeographical information systems.14aComputer Science.24aInformation Systems and Communication Service.24aGeographical Information Systems/Cartography.24aArtificial Intelligence (incl.

Hardly any critical enterprise solution comes without any functionality for managing data in its different forms. Web-Scale Data Management for the Cloud addresses fundamental challenges posed by the need and desire to provide database functionality in the context of the Database as a Service (DBaaS) paradigm for database outsourcing. This book also discusses the motivation of the new paradigm of cloud computing, and its impact to data outsourcing and service-oriented computing in data-intensive applications. Techniques with respect to the support in the current cloud environments, major challenges, and future trends are covered in the last section of this book. A survey addressing the techniques and special requirements for building database services are provided in this book as well. 0aComputer science. 0aComputer Communication Networks. 0aInformation systems. 0aDatabase management.14aComputer Science.24aDatabase Management.24aComputer Communication Networks.24aInformation Systems Applications (incl.

Collaborative Filtering (CF) is one of the most popular techniques in recommender systems. The CF recommends items to a target user based on the preferences of a set of similar users known as the neighbors, generated from a database made up of the preferences of past users. In the absence of these ratings, trust between the users could be used to choose the neighbor for recommendation making. Better recommendations can be achieved using an inferred trust network which mimics the real world “friend of a friend” recommendations. To extend the boundaries of the neighbor, an effective trust inference technique is required. This book proposes a trust interference technique called Directed Series Parallel Graph (DSPG) that has empirically outperformed other popular trust inference algorithms, such as TidalTrust and MoleTrust. For times when reliable explicit trust data is not available, this book outlines a new method called SimTrust for developing trust networks based on a user’s interest similarity. To identify the interest similarity, a user’s personalized tagging information is used. However, particular emphasis is given in what resources the user chooses to tag, rather than the text of the tag applied. The commonalities of the resources being tagged by the users can be used to form the neighbors used in the automated recommender system. Through a series of case studies and empirical results, this book highlights the effectiveness of this tag-similarity based method over the traditional collaborative filtering approach, which typically uses rating data. Trust for Intelligent Recommendation is intended for practitioners as a reference guide for developing improved, trust-based recommender systems. Researchers in a related field will also find this book valuable. 0aComputer science. 0aData mining. 0aArtificial intelligence.14aComputer Science.24aData Mining and Knowledge Discovery.24aInformation Systems Applications (incl.

These decisions are not made by combining many isolated trust evaluations. Many interlocking factors play a role, each dynamically impacting the others.  In this brief, "trust context" is defined as the system level description of how the trust evaluation process unfolds.Networks today are part of almost all human activity, supporting and shaping it. Applications increasingly incorporate new interdependencies and new trust contexts. Social networks connect people and organizations throughout the globe in cooperative and competitive activities. Information is created and consumed at a global scale. Systems, devices, and sensors create and process data, manage physical systems, and participate in interactions with other entities, people and systems alike.  To study trust in such applications, we need a multi-disciplinary approach.  This book reviews the components of the trust context through a broad review of recent literature in many different fields of study. Common threads relevant to the trust context across many application domains are also illustrated. 0aComputer science. 0aComputer Communication Networks. 0aComputer simulation.14aComputer Science.24aComputer Communication Networks.24aSimulation and Modeling.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer eBooks08iPrinted edition:z9781461470304 0aSpringerBriefs in Computer Science,x2191-576840uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-7031-1  aZDB-2-SCS  aComputer Science (Springer-11645)02299nam a22004335i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001300172072001600185072002300201082001600224100002200240245012300262260006700385300003600452490005100488505020800539520063200747650001701379650003301396650001901429650002301448650001701471650004201488650003901530650003501569700002001604710003401624773002001658776003601678830005101714856004801765912001401813950003801827978-1-4614-7079-3DE-He21320130330062157.0cr nn 008mamaa130330s2013    xxu|    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97814614707939978-1-4614-7079-37 a10.1007/978-1-4614-7079-32doi 4aTK1-9971 7aTJK2bicssc 7aTEC0410002bisacsh04a621.3822231 aIsmail, Muhammad.10aCooperative Networking in a Heterogeneous Wireless Mediumh[electronic resource] /cby Muhammad Ismail, Weihua Zhuang.  aNew York, NY :bSpringer New York :bImprint: Springer,c2013.  aVIII, 90 p. 29 illus.bdigital.0 aSpringerBriefs in Computer Science,x2191-57680 aIntroduction -- Decentralized Optimal Resource Allocation -- Prediction Based Resource Allocation -- Resource Allocation for Single-network and Multi-homing Services -- Conclusions and Future Directions.  aThis brief focuses on radio resource allocation in a heterogeneous wireless medium.

The book examines U.S. counterterrorism history, technologies, and strategies from a unique and thought-provoking approach that encompasses personal experiences, investigative journalism, historical and current events, ideas from great thought leaders, and even the make-believe of Hollywood. Demystifying Total Information Awareness, the author expounds on the U.S. intelligence community, artificial intelligence in data mining, social media and privacy, cyber attacks and prevention, causes and cures for terrorism, and longstanding issues of war and peace. The book offers practical advice for businesses, governments, and individuals to better secure the world and protect cyberspace. It quotes U.S. Navy Admiral and NATO’s Supreme Allied Commander James Stavridis: “Instead of building walls to create security, we need to build bridges.” The book also provides a glimpse into the future of Plan X and Generation Z, along with an ominous prediction from security advisor Marc Goodman at TEDGlobal 2012: “If you control the code, you control the world.” Counterterrorism and Cybersecurity: Total Information Awareness will keep you up at night but at the same time give you some peace of mind knowing that “our problems are manmade — therefore they can be solved by man [or woman],” as President John F. Kennedy said at the American University commencement in June 1963. 0aComputer science. 0aData mining. 0aMultimedia systems. 0aInformation Systems.14aComputer Science.24aInformation Systems Applications (incl.

They are applied in many different contexts, in particular in optimization, and analysis of such algorithms has seen tremendous advances in recent years.  In this book the author provides an introduction to the methods used to analyze evolutionary algorithms and other randomized search heuristics. He starts with an algorithmic and modular perspective and gives guidelines for the design of evolutionary algorithms. He then places the approach in the broader research context with a chapter on theoretical perspectives. By adopting a complexity-theoretical perspective, he derives general limitations for black-box optimization, yielding lower bounds on the performance of evolutionary algorithms, and then develops general methods for deriving upper and lower bounds step by step. This main part is followed by a chapter covering practical applications of these methods.  The notational and mathematical basics are covered in an appendix, the results presented are derived in detail, and each chapter ends with detailed comments and pointers to further reading. So the book is a useful reference for both graduate students and researchers engaged with the theoretical analysis of such algorithms.  0aComputer science. 0aInformation theory. 0aArtificial intelligence. 0aMathematical optimization. 0aEngineering.14aComputer Science.24aTheory of Computation.24aComputational Intelligence.24aOptimization.24aArtificial Intelligence (incl.

Einzelkomponenten werden aufgezeigt und in ihrem aktuellen Stand diskutiert. Die Experten der jeweiligen Disziplinen (bspw. neurobiologische Grundlagen, Story-Telling, Drehbuch, Visual Effects, Auto Alignment, Stiching, Projektionstechnologie, Hardware) stellen den Forschungsstand, Anwendungen und Ausblicke u.a. für die Bereiche Marketing, Bildung, Entertainment und Medizinische Applikationen vor. Das Fachbuch schließt die Lücke zwischen stattfindenden Entwicklungen und wenig vorhandenen und kaum verknüpften Veröffentlichungen. Der Inhalt beschäftigt sich mit Potenzialen eines neuen Marktes, der sich in der Vergangenheit ausgehend von den Planetarien und Amusement-Parks auf die Bereiche Bildung und Entertainment konzentriert. Die Autoren stellen Frameworks aus ihren Arbeiten und Best-Practice-Beispiele vor. 0aComputer science. 0aComputer vision. 0aMarketing.14aComputer Science.24aImage Processing and Computer Vision.24aMarketing.24aImage Processing and Computer Vision.24aLight Construction, Steel Construction, Timber Construction.24aEducation (general).1 aSchröder, Ute B.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer eBooks08iPrinted edition:z9783642246555 0aX.media.press,x1439-310740uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-24656-2  aZDB-2-STI  aComputer Science and Engineering (German Language) (Springer-11774)02824nam a22004335i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001800172072001600190072001700206072002300223082001400246100002200260245009600282250003100378260008200409300005700491490001300548505036200561520101800923650001701941650001801958650002501976650001702001650004302018650006302061650002902124710003402153773002002187776003602207830001302243856004802256912001402304950007202318978-3-642-25862-6DE-He21320130413045659.0cr nn 008mamaa130413s2013    gw |    s    |||| 0|ger d  a97836422586269978-3-642-25862-67 a10.1007/978-3-642-25862-62doi 4aTL787-4050.22 7aTRP2bicssc 7aTTDS2bicssc 7aTEC0020002bisacsh04a629.12231 aMensen, Heinrich.10aPlanung, Anlage und Betrieb von Flugplätzenh[electronic resource] /cvon Heinrich Mensen.  a2., neu bearb.

Later on this criterion was no longer critical, since hardware had become inexpensive. Meanwhile, however, people have realized that performance again plays a significant role, because of the major drain on system resources involved in developing complex applications. This book distinguishes between three levels of performance optimization: the system level, application level and business processes level. On each, optimizations can be achieved and cost-cutting potentials can be identified. The book presents the relevant theoretical background and measuring methods as well as proposed solutions. An evaluation of network monitors and checklists rounds out the work. 0aComputer science. 0aOperating systems (Computers).14aComputer Science.24aPerformance and Reliability.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer eBooks08iPrinted edition:z978364229970440uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-29971-1  aZDB-2-SCS  aComputer Science (Springer-11645)03525nam a22004335i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001600172072001600188072002300204082001500227100001700242245018100259260008900440300005800529505082900587520116001416650001702576650003502593650002602628650002502654650003002679650001702709650002502726650002002751650004702771650002302818650002602841710003402867773002002901776003602921856004802957912001403005950007203019978-3-642-30655-6DE-He21320130420074945.0cr nn 008mamaa130420s2013    gw |    s    |||| 0|ger d  a97836423065569978-3-642-30655-67 a10.1007/978-3-642-30655-62doi 4aTK9001-9401 7aTHK2bicssc 7aTEC0280002bisacsh04a621.482231 aLaufs, Paul.10aReaktorsicherheit für Leistungskernkraftwerkeh[electronic resource] :bDie Entwicklung im politischen und technischen Umfeld der Bundesrepublik Deutschland /cvon Paul Laufs.  aBerlin, Heidelberg :bSpringer Berlin Heidelberg :bImprint: Springer Vieweg,c2013.  aXXVIII, 1116 S. 643 Abb., 35 Abb. in Farbe.bdigital.0 aDie Anfänge der Kernspaltung -- Die Anfänge der friedlichen Kernenergienutzung und ihre Sicherheitsprobleme -- Schadensereignisse, extreme Tests und Unfälle in Reaktoranlagen, ihre öffentliche Wahrnehmung und ihre Folgen -- Die Suche nach der richtigen Sicherheitskonzeption -- Die Deterministik bei Auslegung, Konstruktion und Herstellung -- Die Probabilistik und die Frage nach dem Restrisiko -- Mensch-Technik-Organisation -- Die Sicherheit des Reaktordruckbehälters (RDB) von Druckwasserreaktoren -- Forschungen zur Qualitätssicherung und Quantifizierung des Sicherheitsabstands für druckführende Umschließungen -- Die Basissicherheit und das Basissicherheitskonzept für die druckführende Umschließung -- Neue fortschrittliche Ansätze für Leichwasserreaktoren -- Zukunftsoption Kernenergie in Deutschland?.  aDas Werk beschreibt die Entwicklung der Reaktorsicherheit deutscher Leichtwasser-Kernkraftwerke aus den Anfängen heraus mit ihren vielfältigen Bezügen zu ausländischen Vorbildern, zu nationalen und internationalen Forschungsvorhaben sowie zu konventionellen und nuklearen Schadensereignissen. Detaillierte und reich bebilderte Darstellungen befassen sich mit den spezifischen Sicherheitstechniken, wie der Berstsicherheit der druckführenden Umschließung, der Sicherstellung der Notkühlung im Kühlmittelverlust-Störfall, der Leittechnik und dem Umgebungsschutz durch das Containment. Die Ergebnisse nationaler und internationaler Risikostudien werden erörtert. Es wird gezeigt, wie die Anstrengungen von Industrie, Staat und Wissenschaft zur Erhöhung der Sicherheitsreserven und zur Verbesserung der Sicherheitskultur  in einem gesellschaftlichen Umfeld vorangetrieben wurden, in dem die Frage der Kernenergienutzung zu einem zentralen Thema der politischen Auseinandersetzungen wurde.Das Buch ist in einer auch für den interessierten Nichtfachmann verständlichen Sprache geschrieben und bietet viele Materialien für weiterführende Studien. 0aEngineering. 0aPolitical sciencexPhilosophy. 0aElectric engineering. 0aNuclear engineering. 0aEnvironmental protection.14aEngineering.24aNuclear Engineering.24aNuclear Energy.24aEffects of Radiation/Radiation Protection.24aEnergy Technology.24aPolitical Philosophy.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer eBooks08iPrinted edition:z978364230654940uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-30655-6  aZDB-2-STI  aComputer Science and Engineering (German Language) (Springer-11774)03558nam a22004095i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001300172072001600185072002300201082001400224100002200238245018500260260008200445300003800527490007900565505050700644520153001151650002202681650002602703650002502729650002202754650002602776650005302802650002402855710003402879773002002913776003602933830007902969856004803048912001403096950003803110978-3-642-30764-5DE-He21320130215194504.0cr nn 008mamaa130109s2013    gw |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97836423076459978-3-642-30764-57 a10.1007/978-3-642-30764-52doi 4aQA76.758 7aUMZ2bicssc 7aCOM0512302bisacsh04a005.12231 aTrendowicz, Adam.10aSoftware Cost Estimation, Benchmarking, and Risk Assessmenth[electronic resource] :bThe Software Decision-Makers' Guide to Predictable Software Development /cby Adam Trendowicz.  aBerlin, Heidelberg :bSpringer Berlin Heidelberg :bImprint: Springer,c2013.  aXXVI, 322 p. 104 illus.bdigital.0 aThe Fraunhofer IESE Series on Software and Systems Engineering,x2193-81990 aPart I Predictable Software Development.-Why Software Effort Estimation? -- What is a Good Estimate? -- Why the CoBRA Method? -- Part II The CoBRA Method -- Principles of the CoBRA Method -- Model Development and Validation -- Model Application -- Usage Scenarios of a CoBRA Model -- Part III Industrial Applications -- Software design & management, Germany -- Allette Systems, Australia -- Oki Electric, Japan -- Siemens Information Systems, India -- Japan Manned Space Systems, Japan -- Bibliography.  aSoftware effort estimation is a key element of software project planning and management. Yet, in industrial practice, the important role of effort estimation is often underestimated and/or misunderstood.In this book, Adam Trendowicz presents the CoBRA method  (an abbreviation for Cost Estimation, Benchmarking, and Risk Assessment) for estimating the effort required to successfully complete a software development project, which uniquely combines human judgment and measurement data in order to systematically create a custom-specific effort estimation model. CoBRA goes far beyond simply predicting the development effort; it supports project decision-makers in negotiating the project scope, managing project risks, benchmarking productivity, and directing improvement activities. To illustrate the method’s practical use, the book reports several real-world cases where CoBRA was applied in various industrial contexts. These cases represent different estimation contexts in terms of software project environment, estimation objectives, and estimation constraints.This book is the result of a successful collaboration between the process management division of Fraunhofer IESE and many software companies in the field of software engineering technology transfer. It mainly addresses software practitioners who deal with planning and managing software development projects as part of their daily work, and is also of interest for students or courses specializing in software engineering or software project management. 0aComputer science. 0aSoftware engineering. 0aInformation Systems.14aComputer Science.24aSoftware Engineering.24aManagement of Computing and Information Systems.24aProject Management.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer eBooks08iPrinted edition:z9783642307638 0aThe Fraunhofer IESE Series on Software and Systems Engineering,x2193-819940uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-30764-5  aZDB-2-SCS  aComputer Science (Springer-11645)03455nam a22003855i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001300172072001600185072002300201082001400224100002000238245010900258260008200367300003500449490002800484505124700512520093301759650002202692650002602714650002202740650002602762650002902788710003402817773002002851776003602871830002802907856004802935912001402983950007202997978-3-642-31768-2DE-He21320130217115245.0cr nn 008mamaa130125s2013    gw |    s    |||| 0|ger d  a97836423176829978-3-642-31768-27 a10.1007/978-3-642-31768-22doi 4aQA76.758 7aUMZ2bicssc 7aCOM0512302bisacsh04a005.12231 aGöhner, Peter.10aAgentensysteme in der Automatisierungstechnikh[electronic resource] /cherausgegeben von Peter Göhner.  aBerlin, Heidelberg :bSpringer Berlin Heidelberg :bImprint: Springer,c2013.  aXIV, 303 S. 113 Abb.bdigital.0 aXpert.press,x1439-54280 aEinsatz von Agentensystemen zur Optimierung der Logistik in Produktions- und Agrarprozessen -- Ready for Take-Off - Softwareagenten disponieren Flugcharter-Verkehr -- Freie Fahrt - Softwareagenten reduzieren Schadstoffausstoß -- Agenten-basierte Koordination und Überwachung des Designs mechatronischer -- Einsatz von Agentensystemen in der Intralogistik -- Identifikation und Umsetzung von Agenten zur Fabrikautomation unter Nutzung von mechatronischen Strukturierungskonzepten -- Einsatz von Softwareagenten am Beispiel einer kontinuierlichen, hydraulischen Heizpresse -- KREAagentuse – Werkzeugunterstützung für die Entwicklung von SPS-basierten Softwareagenten -- Funktionaler Anwendungsentwurf für agentenbasierte, verteilte Automatisierungssysteme -- Energiesysteme und das Paradigma des Agenten -- Agentenbasierte Verteilnetzautomatisierung -- Von Softwareagenten zu Cyber-Physical Systems -- Technologien und Anwendungen -- Entwicklungsmethodiken für agentenbasierte Systeme -- Middleware für Plattformen für mobile Agenten in der Automatisierung -- Agentenbasiertes Selbstmanagement von Automatisierungssystemen -- Agentenbasierte dynamische Testfallpriorisierung -- Agenten und Assistenzsysteme in der Anlagenautomation.  aBei modernen automatisierten Systemen gewinnen Anforderungen an die Flexibilität (z.

Vielfach ist jedoch noch unklar, wie die gewünschte Flexibilität bei der Entwicklung eines automatisierten Systems erzielt und die dadurch entstehenden komplexen Abläufe und Verhaltensweisen beherrscht werden können. Mit Hilfe von Softwareagenten wird es möglich, die notwendige Flexibilität von automatisierten Systemen systematisch zu entwerfen. Im GMA-Fachausschuss 5.15 „Agentensysteme“ erarbeiten Fachleute aus Wissenschaft und Industrie Richtlinien zur Entwicklung und Anwendung von Agentensystemen in der Automatisierungstechnik. Im Rahmen dieser Arbeiten sind viele Beiträge zum Stand der Technik bzw.

What is a natural process for a human turns out to be an extremely hard task for a machine: computers can’t represent knowledge as effectively as humans do, which hampers, for example, meaning disambiguation and communication. Applied ontologies and NLP have been developed to face these challenges. Integrating ontologies with (possibly multilingual) lexical resources is an essential requirement to make human language understandable by machines, and also to enable interoperability and computability across information systems and, ultimately, in the Web.  This book explores recent advances in the integration of ontologies and lexical resources, including questions such as building the required infrastructure (e.g., the Semantic Web) and different formalisms, methods and platforms for eliciting, analyzing and encoding knowledge contents (e.g., multimedia, emotions, events, etc.).  The contributors look towards next-generation technologies, shifting the focus from the state of the art to the future of Ontologies and Lexical Resources.  This work will be of interest to research scientists, graduate students, and professionals in the fields of knowledge engineering, computational linguistics, and semantic technologies.   0aComputer science. 0aOntology. 0aData mining. 0aMathematics. 0aComputational linguistics.14aComputer Science.24aData Mining and Knowledge Discovery.24aApplications of Mathematics.24aComputational Linguistics.24aOntology.24aUser Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction.1 aVossen, Piek.1 aQin, Lu.1 aHovy, Eduard.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer eBooks08iPrinted edition:z9783642317811 0aTheory and Applications of Natural Language Processing,x2192-032X40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-31782-8  aZDB-2-SCS  aComputer Science (Springer-11645)02811nam a22004095i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001600172072001600188072001700204072002300221082001600244100001900260245008700279260008200366300005700448490007200505505033100577520108800908650002201996650001702018650001602035650002202051650004102073650002502114710003402139773002002173776003602193830007202229856004802301912001402349950003802363978-3-642-31821-4DE-He21320130321191144.0cr nn 008mamaa130107s2013    gw |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97836423182149978-3-642-31821-47 a10.1007/978-3-642-31821-42doi 4aQA76.9.D343 7aUNF2bicssc 7aUYQE2bicssc 7aCOM0210302bisacsh04a006.3122231 aShen, Hua-Wei.10aCommunity Structure of Complex Networksh[electronic resource] /cby Hua-Wei Shen.  aBerlin, Heidelberg :bSpringer Berlin Heidelberg :bImprint: Springer,c2013.  aXIV, 120 p. 48 illus., 17 illus. in color.bdigital.0 aSpringer Theses, Recognizing Outstanding Ph.D. Research,x2190-50530 aCommunity structure: An Introduction -- Detecting the overlapping and hierarchical community structure in networks -- Multiscale community detection in networks with heterogeneous degree distributions -- Community structure and diffusion dynamics on networks -- Exploratory Analysis of the structural regularities in networks.  aCommunity structure is a salient structural characteristic of many real-world networks. Communities are generally hierarchical, overlapping, multi-scale and coexist with other types of structural regularities of networks. This poses major challenges for conventional methods of community detection. This book will comprehensively introduce the latest advances in community detection, especially the detection of overlapping and hierarchical community structures, the detection of multi-scale communities in heterogeneous networks, and the exploration of multiple types of structural regularities. These advances have been successfully applied to analyze large-scale online social networks, such as Facebook and Twitter. This book provides readers a convenient way to grasp the cutting edge of community detection in complex networks.The thesis on which this book is based was honored with the “Top 100 Excellent Doctoral Dissertations Award” from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and was nominated as the “Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation” by the Chinese Computer Federation. 0aComputer science. 0aData mining. 0aStatistics.14aComputer Science.24aData Mining and Knowledge Discovery.24aStatistics, general.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer eBooks08iPrinted edition:z9783642318207 0aSpringer Theses, Recognizing Outstanding Ph.D. Research,x2190-505340uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-31821-4  aZDB-2-SCS  aComputer Science (Springer-11645)02830nam a22004695i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001200172072001600184072001700200072002300217082001400240100002000254245015300274260008200427300003500509505022100544520100100765650001701766650002801783650002601811650002701837650001701864650002801881650004301909650002301952650004301975650005602018650002002074700001902094700002302113710003402136773002002170776003602190856004802226912001402274950007202288978-3-642-31986-0DE-He21320130220180317.0cr nn 008mamaa130217s2013    gw |    s    |||| 0|ger d  a97836423198609978-3-642-31986-07 a10.1007/978-3-642-31986-02doi 4aTL1-483 7aTRC2bicssc 7aTRCS2bicssc 7aTEC0090902bisacsh04a629.22231 aKampker, Achim.10aElektromobilitäth[electronic resource] :bGrundlagen einer Zukunftstechnologie /cherausgegeben von Achim Kampker, Dirk Vallée, Armin Schnettler.  aBerlin, Heidelberg :bSpringer Berlin Heidelberg :bImprint: Springer,c2013.  aXII, 334 S. 194 Abb.bdigital.0 aEinleitung -- Grundlagen -- Infrastruktur -- Geschäftsmodelle entlang der elektromobilen Wertschöpfungskette -- Fahrzeugkonzeption für die Elektromobilität.- Entwicklung von elektrofahrzeugspezifischen Systemen.  aDas Buch gibt einen umfassenden Überblick über die Herausforderungen und Lösungen zum Thema Elektromobilität.

To learn autonomously and in a cumulative fashion is one of the hallmarks of intelligence, and we know that higher mammals engage in exploratory activities that are not directed to pursue goals of immediate relevance for survival and reproduction but are instead driven by intrinsic motivations such as curiosity, interest in novel stimuli or surprising events, and inter­est in learning new behaviours. The adaptive value of such intrinsically motivated activities lies in the fact that they allow the cumulative acquisition of knowledge and skills that can be used later to accomplish ﬁtness-enhanc­ing goals. Intrinsic motivations continue during adulthood, and in humans they underlie lifelong learning, artistic creativity, and scientific discovery, while they are also the basis for processes that strongly affect human well-being, such as the sense of competence, self-determination, and self-esteem.This book has two aims: to present the state of the art in research on intrinsically motivated learning, and to identify the related scientific and technological open challenges and most promising research directions. The book introduces the concept of intrinsic motivation in artificial systems, reviews the relevant literature, offers insights from the neural and behavioural sciences, and presents novel tools for research. The book is organized into six parts: the chapters in Part I give general overviews on the concept of intrinsic motivations, their function, and possible mechanisms for implementing them; Parts II, III, and IV focus on three classes of intrinsic motivation mechanisms, those based on predictors, on novelty, and on competence; Part V discusses mechanisms that are complementary to intrinsic motivations; and Part VI introduces tools and experimental frameworks for investigating intrinsic motivations.The contributing authors are among the pioneers carrying out fundamental work on this topic, drawn from related disciplines such as artificial intelligence, robotics, artificial life, evolution, machine learning, developmental psychology, cognitive science, and neuroscience. The book will be of value to graduate students and academic researchers in these domains, and to engineers engaged with the design of autonomous, adaptive robots. 0aComputer science. 0aNeurosciences. 0aArtificial intelligence. 0aEngineering. 0aConsciousness.14aComputer Science.24aArtificial Intelligence (incl.

Importantly, BPM is not about improving the way individual activities are performed, but rather about managing entire chains of events, activities and decisions that ultimately produce added value for an organization and its customers.This textbook encompasses the entire BPM lifecycle, from process identification to process monitoring, covering along the way process modelling, analysis, redesign and automation. Concepts, methods and tools from business management, computer science and industrial engineering are blended into one comprehensive and inter-disciplinary approach. The presentation is illustrated using the BPMN industry standard defined by the Object Management Group and widely endorsed by practitioners and vendors worldwide.   In addition to explaining the relevant conceptual background, the book provides dozens of examples, more than 100 hands-on exercises – many with solutions – as well as numerous suggestions for further reading. The textbook is the result of many years of combined teaching experience of the authors, both at the undergraduate and graduate levels as well as in the context of professional training. Students and professionals from both business management and computer science will benefit from the step-by-step style of the textbook and its focus on fundamental concepts and proven methods. Lecturers will appreciate the class-tested format and the additional teaching material available on the accompanying website fundamentals-of-bpm.org. 0aComputer science. 0aSoftware engineering. 0aInformation systems. 0aManagement information systems.14aComputer Science.24aComputer Appl. in Administrative Data Processing.24aBusiness Information Systems.24aInformation Systems Applications (incl.

aDieser Praxis-Ratgeber versucht, dem Leser ein intuitives Gespür für elektromagnetisch verträgliche Produktentwicklung zu vermitteln. Im Zentrum der Betrachtung liegt die Praxis: Analyse von Verträglichkeitsproblemen, Beseitigung und Vermeidung. Der Autor stellt die Grundlagen der elektromagnetischen Verträglichkeit einfach und verständlich dar und entwickelt klare Bewertungskriterien für Testmessungen und Analysen. Im Detail wird dargelegt, welche Schritte beim Entwurf zu beachten sind, wie sich externe Störungen fortpflanzen und wie man die Auswirkungen verhindern kann. Der Autor behandelt auch die Messung und Bewertung von EMV-Störungen, auf mehreren Ebenen: entwicklungsbegleitend (Prototypen Test), mit genormten Mitteln und im akkreditierten Testhaus. Der Inhalt·         Grundlagen der Messtechnik·         Wellenfortpflanzung·         Arten von Störungen·         Simulation von Feldern·         Messaufbauten·         Normen-Interpretation und Grenzwerte·         Eigene Messungen und Richtlinien zum Design·         Konzepte für EMV-gerechte Signalverarbeitung Die Zielgruppen·         Elektronik-Entwickler, die Produkte nach Konformitätsrichtlinien konzipieren wollen·         Studierende, die sich mit EMV beschäftigen sowie angehende Techniker in Testhäusern. Der AutorDieter Stotz ist seit vielen Jahren als Entwickler für Sensorik und Signalverarbeitung tätig und begleitet Neuentwicklungen von der Konzeption bis zur Serienreife stets mit Fokus auf EMV und störungssicherer Ausführung. Durch den Kontakt zu einigen Testhäusern wird er immer wieder auch mit der praktischen Durchführung normgerechter Messungen konfrontiert, sodass die Umsetzung der Richtlinien stets nach neuesten Erkenntnissen und Festlegungen erfolgen kann. 0aEngineering. 0aMicrowaves. 0aElectronics. 0aProduction of electric energy or power.14aEngineering.24aElectronics and Microelectronics, Instrumentation.24aMicrowaves, RF and Optical Engineering.24aPower Electronics, Electrical Machines and Networks.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer eBooks08iPrinted edition:z978364234344540uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-34345-2  aZDB-2-STI  aComputer Science and Engineering (German Language) (Springer-11774)03346nam a22004095i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001300172072001600185072002300201072002300224082001600247100002100263245011800284260008200402300003500484490003400519505018900553520179900742650001702541650002902558650003102587650001702618650003102635650004602666710003402712773002002746776003602766830003402802856004802836912001402884950003802898978-3-642-34372-8DE-He21320130217122706.0cr nn 008mamaa130217s2013    gw |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97836423437289978-3-642-34372-87 a10.1007/978-3-642-34372-82doi 4aP98-98.5 7aCFX2bicssc 7aLAN0090002bisacsh 7aCOM0180002bisacsh04a410.2852231 aRadev, Dragomir.10aPuzzles in Logic, Languages and Computationh[electronic resource] :bThe Green Book /cedited by Dragomir Radev.  aBerlin, Heidelberg :bSpringer Berlin Heidelberg :bImprint: Springer,c2013.  aXV, 191 p. 55 illus.bdigital.0 aRecreational Linguistics ;v20 aForeword by James Pustejovsky -- Preface -- Volume 2 Problems -- Volume 2 Solutions -- Index of Languages -- Index of Computational Topics -- Index of Other Topics -- About the Editor.  aThis is the second volume of a unique collection that brings together the best English-language problems created for students competing in the Computational Linguistics Olympiad. These problems are representative of the diverse areas presented in the competition and designed with three principles in mind:· To challenge the student analytically, without requiring any explicit knowledge or experience in linguistics or computer science;· To expose the student to the different kinds of reasoning required when encountering a new phenomenon in a language, both as a theoretical topic and as an applied problem;· To foster the natural curiosity students have about the workings of their own language, as well as to introduce them to the beauty and structure of other languages;· To learn about the models and techniques used by computers to understand human language.Aside from being a fun intellectual challenge, the Olympiad mimics the skills used by researchers and scholars in the field of computational linguistics.In an increasingly global economy where businesses operate across borders and languages, having a strong pool of computational linguists is a competitive advantage, and an important component to both security and growth in the 21st century.This collection of problems is a wonderful general introduction to the field of linguistics through the analytic problem solving technique."A fantastic collection of problems for anyone who is curious about how human language works!

Prozessreifegradmodelle wie CMMI erfordern dazu quantitative Methoden als Werkzeug des Entwicklungsmanagements.Mit der modellgetriebenen Entwicklung steht eine Datenbasis für eine durchgehende quantitative Analyse zur Verfügung. Modellanalysen erlauben eine prozessbegleitende Qualitätsmessung und die Bestimmung der Produktkomplexität und des Entwicklungsfortschritts. Das Buch stellt bestehende Methoden des quantitativen Entwicklungsmanagements zur Entscheidungsunterstützung  auf operativer und strategischer Ebene vor. Die Autoren zeigen eine Werkzeugsammlung für das Entwicklungsmanagement auf operativer und strategischer Ebene bereit. Sie zeigen, wie die modellgetriebene Entwicklung zur Analyse der erreichten Ergebnisse genutzt werden kann, etwa zur Bewertung von Methoden, Werkzeugen sowie zur Prozess- oder Projektanpassung. Der Inhalt- Quantitative Methoden für die Bewertung der Produktentwicklung- Umsetzung der Forderungen von Prozessreifemodellen wie CMMI/ SPICE- Prozessorientiertes Produktqualitätsmonitoring  Die Zielgruppen- Entwicklungs- und Projektleiter in Industrieunternehmen- Strategisches und operatives Management Die AutorenProf. Dr.-Ing.

Furthermore, C++ compiles highly efficient native code. This unique and effective combination makes C++ well-suited for programming microcontroller systems that require compact size, high performance and safety-critical reliability.With this book, Chris Kormanyos delivers a highly practical guide to programming real-time embedded microcontroller systems in C++. It is divided into three parts plus several appendices. Part I provides a foundation for real-time C++ by covering language technologies, including object-oriented methods, template programming and optimization. Next, part II presents detailed descriptions of a variety of C++ components that are widely used in microcontroller programming. It details some of C++’s most powerful language elements, such as class types, templates and the STL, to develop components for microcontroller register access, low-level drivers, custom memory management, embedded containers, multitasking, etc.  Finally, part III describes mathematical methods and generic utilities that can be employed to solve recurring problems in real-time C++. The appendices include a brief C++ language tutorial, information on the real-time C++ development environment and instructions for building GNU GCC cross-compilers and a microcontroller circuit.The most recent specification of C++11 in ISO/IEC 14882:2011 is used throughout the text. To facilitate portability, no libraries other than those specified in the language standard itself are used. Efficiency is always in focus and numerous examples are backed up with real-time performance measurements and size analyses that quantify the true costs of the code down to the very last byte and microsecond.The target audience of this book mainly consists of students and professionals interested in real-time C++. Readers should be familiar with C or another programming language and will benefit most if they have had some previous experience with microcontroller electronics and the performance and size issues prevalent in embedded systems programming. 0aComputer science. 0aMicroprogramming. 0aSoftware engineering. 0aComputer system performance. 0aComputer network architectures.14aComputer Science.24aSpecial Purpose and Application-Based Systems.24aSystem Performance and Evaluation.24aComputer System Implementation.24aSoftware Engineering.24aControl Structures and Microprogramming.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer eBooks08iPrinted edition:z978364234687340uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-34688-0  aZDB-2-SCS  aComputer Science (Springer-11645)03611nam a22004455i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001400172072001600186072002300202072002300225082001400248100002200262245013000284250003600414260008900450300005300539505033800592520176600930650001702696650003102713650002802744650002402772650001702796650002602813650001802839650003202857650002402889650002802913710003402941773002002975776003602995856004803031912001403079950007203093978-3-642-34700-9DE-He21320130321194634.0cr nn 008mamaa130228s2013    gw |    s    |||| 0|ger d  a97836423470099978-3-642-34700-97 a10.1007/978-3-642-34700-92doi 4aTA349-359 7aTGB2bicssc 7aSCI0410002bisacsh 7aTEC0090702bisacsh04a620.12231 aSchumacher, Axel.10aOptimierung mechanischer Strukturenh[electronic resource] :bGrundlagen und industrielle Anwendungen /cvon Axel Schumacher.  a2., aktual. u. erg.

Hiervon sind 250 in einheitlicher, illustrierter Tafeldarstellung besprochen.Im Wesentlichen handelt es sich um neuere Beispiele. Ergänzend sind aber die wichtigsten „vorklassischen“ und „klassischen“ Ansätze aufgenommen, so dass das Werk auch die Entwicklung des bionischen Arbeitens aufzeigt.Das Buch wendet sich an Ingenieure und Naturwissenschaftler, Dozenten und Studenten der Fachhochschulen und Universitäten, Journalisten und Medienvertreter. Es empfiehlt sich insbesondere den Bibliotheken der einschlägigen Institute und Forschungseinrichtungen in den Bereichen Hochschule, Industrie und Wirtschaft.Die AutorenProf. emerit. Dr. rer. nat. Werner Nachtigall hat unter anderem Biologie und Technische Physik studiert. Das Zusammenbringen von Biowissenschaften mit den technischen Disziplinen war ihm immer ein wichtiges Anliegen. Er schuf das Begriffspaar „Technische Biologie und Bionik“ (TBB) und arbeitete mit seinen Arbeitsgruppen mehrere Jahrzehnte auf diesem Gebiet, gründete auch die „Gesellschaft für Technische Biologie und Bionik“, deren langjähriger Vorsitzender er war. Er ist Autor von etwa 300 Originalpublikationen und etwa drei Dutzend Büchern sowie Träger mehrerer Preise und gewähltes Mitglied mehrerer Akademien und Gesellschaften. International gilt er mit seinem langjährigen und erfolgreichen Einsatz für die Verankerung der TBB in Wissenschaft und Gesellschaft als einer der bedeutendsten Promotoren der Bionik weltweit.Dr. rer. nat. Alfred Wisser, früher Mitarbeiter bei Prof. Nachtigall, ist Fachzoologe mit dem Schwerpunkt „Funktionsmorphologie bei Insekten“. Ihm sind beispielsweise grundlegende Arbeiten über die Flügelgelenk-Morphologie von Dipteren zu danken. Als Herausgeber der BIONA-reports für Technische Biologie und Bionik, Spezialist für Raster-Elektronenmikroskopie und Datenverarbeitung sowie Projektmanager hat er zusammen mit Prof. Nachtigall bereits mehrere Berichtsbände und Buchprojekte realisiert, wie etwa das Werk „Biologisches Design“ (Springer-Verlag). Auch für das vorliegende Buch hat er u.a. das Bildlayout und das Projektmanagement übernommen. 0aEngineering. 0aMechanics. 0aBiomedical engineering.14aEngineering.24aBiomedical Engineering.24aBiophysics and Biological Physics.24aMechanics.24aBiological Networks, Systems Biology.1 aWisser, Alfred.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer eBooks08iPrinted edition:z978364234766540uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-34767-2  aZDB-2-STI  aComputer Science and Engineering (German Language) (Springer-11774)02533nam a22004095i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001700172072001500189072002300204082001200227100002200239245014500261250001900406260008900425300003200514490002700546505026700573520084500840650002201685650002601707650002201733650003101755650006001786700002601846710003401872773002001906776003601926830002701962856004801989912001402037950007202051978-3-642-34832-7DE-He21320130413051921.0cr nn 008mamaa130413s2013    gw |    s    |||| 0|ger d  a97836423483279978-3-642-34832-77 a10.1007/978-3-642-34832-72doi 4aQA75.5-76.95 7aUY2bicssc 7aCOM0140002bisacsh04a0042231 aRichter, Michael.10aUsability Engineering kompakth[electronic resource] :bBenutzbare Produkte gezielt entwickeln /cvon Michael Richter, Markus D.

Alongside technical aspects of storing, transmitting and processing information, the various semantic aspects of information, such as meaning, sense, reference and function, play a decisive part in the analysis of such systems.With the aim of fostering a better understanding of semantic systems from an evolutionary and multidisciplinary perspective, this volume collects contributions by philosophers and natural scientists, linguists, information and computer scientists. They do not follow a single research paradigm; rather they shed, in a complementary way, new light upon some of the most important aspects of the evolution of semantic systems.Evolution of Semantic Systems is intended for researchers in philosophy, computer science, and the natural sciences who work on the analysis or development of semantic systems, ontologies, or similar complex information structures. In the eleven chapters, they will find a broad discussion of topics ranging from underlying universal principles to representation and processing aspects to paradigmatic examples. 0aComputer science. 0aTechnologyxPhilosophy. 0aCoding theory. 0aArtificial intelligence. 0aComputational linguistics. 0aSemantics.14aComputer Science.24aArtificial Intelligence (incl.

As a reaction to these developments, several regulations have been issued: Corporate Governance, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, IFRS, Basel II and III, Solvency II and BilMoG, to name just a few. In this book, compliance is understood as the process, mapped not only in an internal control system, that is intended to guarantee conformity with legal requirements but also with internal policies and enterprise objectives (in particular, efficiency and profitability).The current literature primarily confines itself to mapping controls in SAP ERP and auditing SAP systems. Maxim Chuprunov not only addresses this subject but extends the aim of internal controls from legal compliance to include efficiency and profitability and then well beyond, because a basic understanding of the processes involved in IT-supported compliance management processes are not delivered along with the software. Starting with the requirements for compliance (Part I), he not only answers compliance-relevant questions in the form of an audit guide for an SAP ERP system and in the form of risks and control descriptions (Part II), but also shows how to automate the compliance management process based on SAP GRC (Part III). He thus addresses the current need for solutions for implementing an integrated GRC system in an organization, especially focusing on the continuous control monitoring topics. Maxim Chuprunov mainly targets compliance experts, auditors, SAP project managers and consultants responsible for GRC products as readers for his book. They will find indispensable information for their daily work from the first to the last page. In addition, MBA, management information system students as well as senior managers like CIOs and CFOs will find a wealth of valuable information on compliance in the SAP ERP environment, on GRC in general and its implementation in particular. 0aComputer science. 0aInformation systems. 0aComputersxLaw and legislation. 0aInformation Systems. 0aAuditing.14aComputer Science.24aComputer Appl. in Administrative Data Processing.24aAccounting/Auditing.24aLegal Aspects of Computing.24aManagement of Computing and Information Systems.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer eBooks08iPrinted edition:z978364235301740uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-35302-4  aZDB-2-SCS  aComputer Science (Springer-11645)03254nam a22004575i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001300172072001600185072001500201072002300216082001400239110001800253245005000271250001900321260008900340300003300429490002700462505040200489520133000891650002202221650002602243650003602269650002202305650006002327650005502387650003402442650005202476700001702528710003402545773002002579776003602599830002702635856004802662912001402710950007202724978-3-642-35446-5DE-He21320130404040736.0cr nn 008mamaa130404s2013    gw |    s    |||| 0|ger d  a97836423544659978-3-642-35446-57 a10.1007/978-3-642-35446-52doi 4aQA76.758 7aUMZ2bicssc 7aUL2bicssc 7aCOM0512302bisacsh04a005.12232 aSOPHIST GmbH.10aSystemanalyse kompakth[electronic resource].  a3.

Mit dem unaufhaltsamen Vordringen der Computertechnik in immer mehr sicherheitskritische Bereiche wird die Software-Qualitätssicherung zu einer stetig wichtiger werdenden Disziplin der Informationstechnik. Aber warum ist die Qualität von Software heute so schlecht? Und viel wichtiger noch: Stehen wir der Misere hilflos gegenüber? Dieses Buch führt umfassend und praxisnah in das Gebiet der Software- Qualitätssicherung ein und gibt eine Antwort auf die oben gestellten Fragen. Zu Beginn werden die typischen Fehlerquellen der Programmentwicklung erörtert und anschließend die verschiedenen Methoden und Techniken behandelt, die uns zur Verbesserung der Qualität zur Verfügung stehen. Behandelt werden die zentralen Themenkomplexe aus den Gebieten der konstruktiven und analytischen Qualitätssicherung, der Software-Infrastruktur und der Managementprozesse. Die 2.

The 22 full papers presented were carefully reviewed and selected from 43 submissions for inclusion in the book. The volume also contains 3 invited talks. ICCS focuses on the useful representation and analysis of conceptual knowledge with research and business applications. It advances the theory and practice in connecting the user's conceptual approach to problem solving with the formal structures that computer applications need to bring their productivity to bear. Conceptual structures (CS) represent a family of approaches that builds on the successes of artificial intelligence, business intelligence, computational linguistics, conceptual modeling, information and Web technologies, user modeling, and knowledge management. 0aComputer science. 0aComputational complexity. 0aDatabase management. 0aInformation storage and retrieval systems. 0aArtificial intelligence. 0aOptical pattern recognition.14aComputer Science.24aArtificial Intelligence (incl.

However, their application to the development of large systems requires more emphasis on specification, modeling, and validation techniques supporting the concepts of reusability and modifiability, and their implementation in new extensions of existing programming languages like Java.This book contains 20 revised papers submitted after the 10th Symposium on Formal Methods for Components and Objects, FMCO 2011, which was held in Turin, Italy, in October 2011. Topics covered include autonomic service-component ensembles; trustworthy eternal systems via evolving software, data, and knowledge; parallel patterns for adaptive heterogeneous multicore systems; programming for future 3D architectures with many cores; formal verification of object oriented software; and an infrastructure for reliable computer systems. 0aComputer science. 0aSoftware engineering. 0aOperating systems (Computers). 0aLogic design.14aComputer Science.24aSoftware Engineering.24aProgramming Languages, Compilers, Interpreters.24aOperating Systems.24aLogics and Meanings of Programs.24aSoftware Engineering/Programming and Operating Systems.24aInformation Systems Applications (incl.

The papers included in this survey cover research in mathematical modeling, design of parallel algorithms, aspects of microprocessor architecture, parallel programming languages, hardware-aware computing, heterogeneous platforms, manycore technologies, performance tuning, and requirements for large-scale applications. The contributions presented in this volume are an outcome of an inspiring conference conceived and organized by the editors at the University of Applied Sciences (HfT) in Stuttgart, Germany, in September 2012. The 10 revised full papers selected from 21 submissions are presented together with the twelve poster abstracts and focus on combination of new aspects of microprocessor technologies, parallel applications, numerical simulation, and software development; thus they clearly show the potential of emerging technologies in the area of multicore and manycore processors that are paving the way towards personal supercomputing and very likely towards exascale computing. 0aComputer science. 0aMemory management (Computer science). 0aComputer system performance. 0aSoftware engineering. 0aComputer graphics.14aComputer Science.24aProcessor Architectures.24aSystem Performance and Evaluation.24aSoftware Engineering/Programming and Operating Systems.24aComputer Graphics.24aArithmetic and Logic Structures.24aMemory Structures.1 aKramer, David.1 aWeiss, Jan-Philipp.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer eBooks08iPrinted edition:z9783642358920 0aLecture Notes in Computer Science,x0302-9743 ;v768640uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-35893-7  aZDB-2-SCS  aZDB-2-LNC  aComputer Science (Springer-11645)04530nam a22004935i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001400172072001600186072002300202082001400225100001600239245024100255260008200496300003700578490007400615505230000689520043202989650002203421650004203443650001803485650003503503650002203538650002903560650003703589650002303626650001803649650003303667700001803700700001803718700001603736700002003752710003403772773002003806776003603826830007403862856004803936912001403984950003803998978-3-642-35898-2DE-He21320130217124845.0cr nn 008mamaa130107s2013    gw |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97836423589829978-3-642-35898-27 a10.1007/978-3-642-35898-22doi 4aTK7895.M5 7aUYF2bicssc 7aCOM0110002bisacsh04a004.12231 aXu, Weixia.10aComputer Engineering and Technologyh[electronic resource] :b16th National Conference, NCCET 2012, Shanghai, China, August 17-19, 2012, Revised Selected Papers /cedited by Weixia Xu, Liquan Xiao, Pingjing Lu, Jinwen Li, Chengyi Zhang.  aBerlin, Heidelberg :bSpringer Berlin Heidelberg :bImprint: Springer,c2013.  aXIV, 263 p. 164 illus.bdigital.0 aCommunications in Computer and Information Science,x1865-0929 ;v3370 aSession 1: Microprocessor and Implementation -- A Method of Balancing the Global Multi-mode Clock Network in Ultra-large Scale CPU -- Hardware Architecture for the Parallel Generation of Long-Period Random Numbers Using MT Method -- MGTE: A Multi-level Hybrid Verification Platform for a 16-Core Processer -- An Efficient Parallel SURF Algorithm for Multi-core Processor -- A Study of Cache Design in Stream Processor -- Design and Implementation of Dynamically Reconfigurable Token Coherence Protocol for Many-Core Processor -- Dynamic and Online Task Scheduling Algorithm Based on Virtual Compute Group in Many-Core Architecture -- ADL and High Performance Processor Design -- Session 2: Design of Integration Circuit -- The Design of the ROHC Header Compression Accelerator -- A Hardware Implementation of Nussinov RNA Folding Algorithm -- A Configurable Architecture for 1-D Discrete Wavelet Transform -- A Comparison of Folded Architectures for the Discrete Wavelet Transform -- A High Performance DSP System with Fault Tolerant for Space Missions -- The Design and Realization of Campus Information Release Platform Based on Android Framework -- A Word-Length Optimized Hardware Gaussian Random Number Generator Based on the Box-Muller Method -- Session 3: I/O Interconnect -- DAMQ Sharing Scheme for Two Physical Channels in High Performance Router -- Design and Implementation of Dynamic Reliable Virtual Channel for Network-on-Chip -- HCCM: A Hierarchical Cross-Connected Mesh for Network on Chip -- Efficient Broadcast Scheme Based on Sub-network Partition for Many-Core CMPs on Gem5 Simulator -- A Quick Method for Mapping Cores Onto 2D-Mesh Based Networks on Chip -- Session 4: Measurement, Verification, and Others -- A Combined Hardware/Software Measurement for ARM Program Execution Time -- A Low-Complexity Parallel Two-Sided Jacobi Complex SVD Algorithm and Architecture for MIMO Beamforming Systems -- A Thermal-Aware Task Mapping Algorithm for Coarse Grain Reconfigurable Computing System -- DC Offset Mismatch Calibration for Time-Interleaved ADCs in High-Speed OFDM Receivers -- An Novel Graph Model for Loop Mapping on Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Architectures -- Memristor Working Condition Analysis Based on SPICE Model -- On Stepsize of Fast Subspace Tracking Methods.  aThis book constitutes the refereed proceedings of the 16th National Conference on Computer Engineering and Technology, NCCET 2012, held in Shanghai, China, in August 2012.

Thus, training future generations of software engineering researchers and bridging the gap between academia and industry are vital to the field. The International Summer School on Software Engineering (ISSSE), which started in 2003, aims to contribute both to training future researchers and to facilitating the exchange of knowledge between academia and industry. This volume consists of chapters originating from a number of tutorial lectures given in 2009, 2010, and 2011 at the International Summer School on Software Engineering, ISSSE, held in Salerno, Italy. The volume has been organized into three parts, focusing on software measurement and empirical software engineering, software analysis, and software management. The topics covered include software architectures, software product lines, model driven software engineering, mechatronic systems, aspect oriented software development, agile development processes, empirical software engineering, software maintenance, impact analysis, traceability management, software testing, and search-based software engineering. 0aComputer science. 0aSoftware engineering. 0aInformation storage and retrieval systems. 0aInformation Systems.14aComputer Science.24aSoftware Engineering.24aProgramming Techniques.24aInformation Systems Applications (incl.

Currently, lots of techniques are available that support the specification and implementation of code generators, such as engines based on templates or rule-based transformations. All those techniques have in common that code generators are either directly programmed or described by means of textual specifications. This monograph presents Genesys, a general approach, which advocates the graphical development of code generators for arbitrary source and target languages, on the basis of models and services. In particular, it is designed to support incremental language development on arbitrary metalevels. The use of models allows building code generators in a truly platform-independent and domain-specific way. Furthermore, models are amenable to formal verification methods such as model checking, which increase the reliability and robustness of the code generators. Services enable the reuse and integration of existing code generation frameworks and tools regardless of their complexity, and at the same time manifest as easy-to-use building blocks which facilitate agile development through quick interchangeability. Both, models and services, are reusable and thus form a growing repository for the fast creation and evolution of code generators. 0aComputer science. 0aSoftware engineering. 0aInformation

The 17 revised full papers presented together with edited transcriptions of some of the discussions following the presentations have gone through multiple rounds of reviewing, revision, and selection. The theme of this workshop was "Brief Encounters". In the old days, security protocols were typically run first as preliminaries to, and later to maintain, relatively stable continuing relationships between relatively unchanging individual entities. Pervasive computing, e-bay and second life have shifted the ground: we now frequently desire a secure commitment to a particular community of entities, but relatively transient relationships with individual members of it, and we are often more interested in validating attributes than identity. The papers and discussions in this volume examine the theme from the standpoint of various different applications and adversaries. 0aComputer science. 0aComputer Communication Networks. 0aData protection. 0aData encryption (Computer science). 0aComputersxLaw and legislation. 0aInformation Systems.14aComputer Science.24aData Encryption.24aComputer Communication Networks.24aManagement of Computing and Information Systems.24aSystems and Data Security.24aInformation Systems Applications (incl.

This situation has led to recent advances in self-adaptive systems able to reconfigure their structure and modify their behavior at run-time to adapt to environmental changes. Despite these advances, one key aspect of self-adaptive systems that remains to be tackled in depth is "assurances": the provision of evidence that the system satisfies its stated functional and non-functional requirements during its operation in the presence of self-adaptation. This book is one of the outcomes of the ESEC/FSE 2011 Workshop on Assurances for Self-Adaptive Systems (ASAS), held in Szeged, Hungary, in September 2011. It contains extended versions of some of the papers presented during the workshop, as well as invited papers from recognized experts. The 12 refereed papers were thoroughly reviewed and selected. The book consists of four parts: formal verification, models and middleware, failure prediction, and assurance techniques. 0aComputer science. 0aComputer Communication Networks. 0aSoftware

BI is now impacted by the “Big Data” phenomena and the evolution of society and users. In particular, BI applications must cope with additional heterogeneous (often Web-based) sources, e.g., from social networks, blogs, competitors’, suppliers’, or distributors’ data, governmental or NGO-based analysis and papers, or from research publications. In addition, they must be able to provide their results also on mobile devices, taking into account location-based or time-based environmental data.The lectures held at the Second European Business Intelligence Summer School (eBISS), which are presented here in an extended and refined format, cover not only established BI and BPM technologies, but extend into innovative aspects that are important in this new environment and for novel applications, e.g., machine learning, logic networks, graph mining, business semantics, large-scale data management and analysis, and multicriteria and collaborative decision making.Combining papers by leading researchers in the field, this volume equips the reader with the state-of-the-art background necessary for creating the future of BI. It also provides the reader with an excellent basis and many pointers for further research in this growing field. 0aEconomics. 0aComputational complexity. 0aComputer science. 0aDatabase management. 0aInformation storage and retrieval systems. 0aInformation systems. 0aManagement information systems.14aEconomics/Management Science.24aBusiness Information Systems.24aComputer Appl. in Administrative Data Processing.24aDatabase Management.24aInformation Storage and Retrieval.24aDiscrete Mathematics in Computer Science.24aProbability and Statistics in Computer Science.1 aZimányi, Esteban.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer eBooks08iPrinted edition:z9783642363177 0aLecture Notes in Business Information Processing,x1865-1348 ;v13840uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-36318-4  aZDB-2-SCS  aComputer Science (Springer-11645)08339nam a22005175i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001600172072001600188072001700204072002300221082001400244100002500258245023200283260008200515300003900597490007400636505582200710520052606532650002207058650003707080650002307117650001707140650004707157650002907204650002207233650005507255650003707310650004607347650004707393650004107440650003907481700001807520700001907538710003407557773002007591776003607611830007407647856004807721912001407769950003807783978-3-642-36321-4DE-He21320130125215231.0cr nn 008mamaa130125s2013    gw |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97836423632149978-3-642-36321-47 a10.1007/978-3-642-36321-42doi 4aQA76.76.A65 7aUNH2bicssc 7aUDBD2bicssc 7aCOM0320002bisacsh04a005.72231 aUnnikrishnan, Srija.10aAdvances in Computing, Communication, and Controlh[electronic resource] :bThird International Conference, ICAC3 2013, Mumbai, India, January 18-19, 2013.

Popular examples include a map in their main offer, for instance for real estate, hotel recommendations, or navigation tools.  Mashups may contain and mix client-side and server-side activity. Obviously, understanding the incoming resources (services, statistical figures, text, videos, etc.) is a precondition for optimally combining them, so that there is always some undercover semantics being used.  By using semantic annotations, neutral mashups permute into the branded type of semantic mashups. Further and deeper semantic processing such as reasoning is the next step.  The chapters of this book reflect the diversity of real-life semantic mashups. Two overview chapters take the reader to the environments where mashups are at home and review the regulations (standards, guidelines etc.) mashups are based on and confronted with. Chapters focusing on DBpedia, search engines and the Web of Things inspect the main Web surroundings of mashups. While mashups upgrading search queries may be nearer to the everyday experience of readers, mashups using DBpedia input and sensor data from the real world lead to important new and therefore less known developments. Finally, the diversity of mashups is tracked through a few application areas: mathematical knowledge, speech, crisis and disaster management, recommendations (for games), inner-city information, and tourism. Participants of the AI Mashup Challenge wrote all the chapters of this book.

However, they have the potential to be mutually beneficial. With this in mind, a writer school was organized in Zinal, Switzerland, in January 2012, within the context of the EU-funded research project PROMISE (Participative Research Laboratory for Multimedia and Multilingual Information Systems Evaluation).  PROMISE aims at advancing the experimental evaluation of complex multimedia and multilingual information systems in order to support individuals, commercial entities, and communities who design, develop, employ, and improve such complex systems. The overall goal of PROMISE is to deliver a unified environment collecting data, knowledge, tools, and methodologies, and to help the user community involved in experimental evaluation. This book constitutes the outcome of the PROMISE Winter School 2012 and contains 11 invited lectures from the research domains information retrieval and information visualization. A large variety of subjects are covered, including hot topics such as crowdsourcing and social media. 0aComputer science. 0aInformation storage and retrieval systems. 0aMultimedia systems.14aComputer Science.24aInformation Storage and Retrieval.24aInformation Systems Applications (incl.

Volume XVI includes extensions of papers from the Rough Sets and Knowledge Technology Conference which was held in Banff, Canada, in October 2011. In addition this book contains a long paper based on a PhD thesis. The papers cover both theory and applications of rough, fuzzy and near sets. They offer a continuation of a number of research streams which have grown out of the seminal work by Zdzislaw Pawlak during the first decade of the 21st century. 0aComputer science. 0aElectronic data processing. 0aArtificial intelligence. 0aComputer vision. 0aOptical pattern recognition.14aComputer Science.24aPattern Recognition.24aArtificial Intelligence (incl.

The theme of the conference was "enterprise information systems of the future –– evolving toward more performance through transparency and agility," mirroring the trend toward more open and more flexible systems.In all, 53 contributions were submitted and after a rigorous review process 10 full papers and 15 short papers were selected for publication in this book. These 25 papers present a well-balanced mix between the traditional social sciences and the novel design science paradigms in enterprise information systems research, and they also include practitioner-oriented and practice-driven contributions. The topics covered fall into three categories: information management in businesses (e.g., enterprise modeling or business process management), information systems from a management perspective (e.g., service innovation, business intelligence, or decision support systems), and ERP offerings and implementations (e.g., software as a service or ERP case studies). 0aEconomics. 0aInformation systems. 0aManagement information systems.14aEconomics/Management Science.24aBusiness Information Systems.24aInformation Systems Applications (incl.

TCCI strives to cover new methodological, theoretical, and practical aspects of CCI understood as the form of intelligence that emerges from the collaboration and competition of many individuals (artificial and/or natural). The application of multiple computational intelligence technologies such as fuzzy systems, evolutionary computation, neural systems, consensus theory, etc., aims to support human and other collective intelligence and to create new forms of CCI in natural and/or artificial systems. This ninth issue contains ten carefully selected and thorougly revised contributions. 0aComputer science. 0aInformation storage and retrieval systems. 0aArtificial intelligence. 0aComputer simulation. 0aEngineering.14aComputer Science.24aArtificial Intelligence (incl.

awarded the E.W. Beth Dissertation Prize for outstanding dissertations in the fields of logic, language, and information. It innovatively combines techniques from linguistics, philosophy of mathematics, and computation to give the first wide-ranging analysis of mathematical language. It focuses particularly on a method for determining the complete meaning of mathematical texts and on resolving technical deficiencies in all standard accounts of the foundations of mathematics. "The thesis does far more than is required for a PhD: it is more like a lifetime's work packed into three years, and is a truly exceptional achievement."

Such computationally enhanced products can perceive and control their environment, analyze their observations, and communicate with other smart objects and human users. Digital product memories (DPMs) will play a key role in the upcoming fourth industrial revolution based on cyber-physical production systems, resulting in improvements in traceability and quality assurance, more efficient and flexible production, logistics, customization, and recycling, and better information for the consumer. SemProM was a major industrial and academic research project that examined all aspects of the design and implementation of semantic product memories, and this book is a comprehensive assessment of the results achieved. The introductory chapters explain the fundamental ideas and the organization of the related project, while the remaining parts explain how to build, model and process DPMs, multimodal interaction using them, and selected applications. This work is inherently multidisciplinary and the related ideas, technologies, and implementations draw on results in fields such as semantic technologies, machine-to-machine communication, intelligent sensor networks, instrumented environments, embedded systems, smart objects, RFID technology, security, and privacy. The contributing authors are leading scientists and engineers, representing key academic teams and companies. The book explains successful deployment in applications such as manufacturing, green logistics, retail, healthcare, and food distribution, and it will be of value to both researchers and practitioners. 0aComputer science. 0aComputer Communication Networks. 0aArtificial intelligence. 0aIndustrial engineering.14aComputer Science.24aArtificial Intelligence (incl.

Since the 1990s, the Internet has become the main driving force behind application development in all domains. An increase in the demand for resource sharing across different sites connected through networks has led to an evolution of data- and knowledge-management systems from centralized systems to decentralized systems enabling large-scale distributed applications providing high scalability. Current decentralized systems still focus on data and knowledge as their main resource. Feasibility of these systems relies basically on P2P (peer-to-peer) techniques and the support of agent systems with scaling and decentralized control. Synergy between grids, P2P systems, and agent technologies is the key to data- and knowledge-centered systems in large-scale environments. This, the eighth issue of Transactions on Large-Scale Data- and Knowledge-Centered Systems, contains eight revised selected regular papers focusing on the following topics: scalable data warehousing via MapReduce, extended OLAP multidimensional models, naive OLAP engines and their optimization, advanced data stream processing and mining, semi-supervised learning of data streams, incremental pattern mining over data streams, association rule mining over data streams, frequent pattern discovery over data streams. 0aComputer science. 0aDatabase management. 0aData mining. 0aInformation storage and retrieval systems. 0aInformation systems.14aComputer Science.24aData Mining and Knowledge Discovery.24aDatabase Management.24aComputer Appl. in Administrative Data Processing.24aInformation Storage and Retrieval.1 aKüng, Josef.1 aWagner, Roland.1 aCuzzocrea, Alfredo.1 aDayal, Umeshwar.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer eBooks08iPrinted edition:z9783642375736 0aLecture Notes in Computer Science,x0302-9743 ;v779040uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-37574-3  aZDB-2-SCS  aZDB-2-LNC  aComputer Science (Springer-11645)03736nam a22005295i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001500172050001400187050001200201072001500213072001600228072002300244072002300267082002000290100002700310245023100337260008200568300003400650490005800684505102600742520081401768650002202582650002402604650001802628650003802646650002202684650003702706650004502743650003002788650002702818650003702845650004002882700002202922710003402944773002002978776003602998830005803034856004803092912001403140912001403154950003803168978-3-642-37635-1DE-He21320130413052141.0cr nn 008mamaa130413s2013    gw |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97836423763519978-3-642-37635-17 a10.1007/978-3-642-37635-12doi 4aQA76.9.L63 4aQA76.5913 4aQA76.63 7aUM2bicssc 7aUYF2bicssc 7aCOM0510002bisacsh 7aCOM0360002bisacsh04a005.10151132231 aMartí-Oliet, Narciso.10aRecent Trends in Algebraic Development Techniquesh[electronic resource] :b21st International Workshop, WADT 2012, Salamanca, Spain, June 7-10, 2012, Revised Selected Papers /cedited by Narciso Martí-Oliet, Miguel Palomino.  aBerlin, Heidelberg :bSpringer Berlin Heidelberg :bImprint: Springer,c2013.  aX, 283 p. 71 illus.bdigital.0 aLecture Notes in Computer Science,x0302-9743 ;v78410 aOpen Multiparty Interaction.- Behaviour Protection in Modular Rule-Based System Specifications.- Quantitative Modal Transition Systems.- Bounded Model Checking of Recursive Programs with Pointers in K.- A Probabilistic Strategy Language for Probabilistic Rewrite Theories and Its Application to Cloud Computing.- Adaptable Transition Systems.- Compiling Logics.- Transformation Systems with Incremental Negative Application Conditions.- Statistical Model Checking for Composite Actor Systems.- Barbed Semantics for Open Reactive Systems.- Designing Domain Specific Languages – A Craftsman’s Approach for the Railway Domain Using Casl.- Satisfiability Calculus: The Semantic Counterpart of a Proof Calculus in General Logics.- Semantics of the Distributed Ontology Language: Institutes and Institutions.- Formal Specification of the Kademlia and the Kad Routing Tables in Maude -- A Generic Program Slicing Technique Based on Language Definitions -- Distances between Processes: A Pure Algebraic Approach.  aThis book constitutes the thoroughly refereed post-conference proceedings of the 21st International Workshop on Algebraic Development Techniques, WADT 2012, held in June 2012, in Salamanca, Spain.

The fragmentation of research agendas and proposed approaches or solutions for securing the future smart grid becomes apparent observing the results from different projects, standards, committees, etc, in different countries. The different approaches and views of the papers in this collection also witness this fragmentation. This book contains three full-paper length invited papers and 7 corrected and extended papers from the First International Workshop on Smart Grid Security, SmartGridSec 2012, which brought together researchers from different communities from academia and industry in the area of securing the Future Smart Grid and was held in Berlin, Germany, on December 3, 2012. 0aComputer science. 0aOperating systems (Computers). 0aData protection. 0aInformation Systems.14aComputer Science.24aSystems and Data Security.24aComputers and Society.24aManagement of Computing and Information Systems.24aOperating Systems.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer eBooks08iPrinted edition:z9783642380297 0aLecture Notes in Computer Science,x0302-9743 ;v782340uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-38030-3  aZDB-2-SCS  aZDB-2-LNC  aComputer Science (Springer-11645)02912nam a22005535i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001300172050002000185072001600205072001800221072002300239082001400262100002200276245035500298260008200653300003600735490007400771520077000845650002201615650004701637650002901684650001501713650002201728650004601750650002901796650002701825650003901852650002701891700001801918700002201936700002201958700002001980700002102000700003202021700002002053700002102073710003402094773002002128776003602148830007402184856004802258912001402306950003802320978-3-642-38061-7DE-He21320130418055804.0cr nn 008mamaa130418s2013    gw |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97836423806179978-3-642-38061-77 a10.1007/978-3-642-38061-72doi 4aQ334-342 4aTJ210.2-211.495 7aUYQ2bicssc 7aTJFM12bicssc 7aCOM0040002bisacsh04a006.32231 aCorchado, Juan M.10aHighlights on Practical Applications of Agents and Multi-Agent Systemsh[electronic resource] :bInternational Workshops of PAAMS 2013, Salamanca, Spain, May 22-24, 2013.

Skarmeta, Kurt Tutschku, Theodore ZahariadisThe Internet is the most vital scientific, technical, economic and societal set of infrastructures in existence and in operation today serving 2.5 billion users. Continuing its developments would secure much of the upcoming innovation and prosperity and it would underpin the sustainable growth in economic values and volumes needed in the future. Future Internet infrastructures research is therefore a must. The Future Internet Assembly (FIA) is a successful conference that brings together participants of over 150 research projects from several distinct yet interrelated areas in the European Union Framework Programme 7 (FP7). The research projects are grouped as follows: the network of the future as infrastructure connecting and orchestrating the future Internet of people, computers, devices, content, clouds and things; cloud computing, Internet of Services and advanced software engineering; the public-private partnership projects on Future Internet; Future Internet Research and Experimentation (FIRE). The 26 full papers included in this volume were selected from 45 submissions. They are organized in topical sections named: software driven networks, virtualization, programmability and autonomic management; computing and networking clouds; internet of things; and enabling technologies and economic incentives. 0aComputer science. 0aComputer Communication Networks. 0aInformation storage and retrieval systems. 0aMultimedia systems. 0aInformation Systems.14aComputer Science.24aComputer Communication Networks.24aInformation Systems Applications (incl.

ToPNoC issues are published as LNCS volumes, and hence are widely distributed and indexed. This Journal has its own Editorial Board which selects papers based on a rigorous two-stage refereeing process. ToPNoC contains: - Revised versions of a selection of the best papers from workshops and tutorials at the annual Petri net conferences - Special sections/issues within particular subareas (similar to those published in the Advances in Petri Nets series) - Other papers invited for publication in ToPNoC - Papers submitted directly to ToPNoC by their authors The 7th volume of ToPNoC contains revised material from the 5th International Summer School “Advanced Course on Petri Nets”, held in September 2010 in Rostock, Germany. The nine papers cover a diverse range of topics including modeling, verification, partial order semantics, and synthesis of Petri nets. In compliance with their origin as course material, the papers are written in survey or tutorial style and give a comprehensive overview of the state of the art in their respective areas. 0aComputer science. 0aSoftware engineering. 0aLogic design.14aComputer Science.24aSoftware Engineering.24aComputation by Abstract Devices.24aLogics and Meanings of Programs.1 aAalst, Wil M.

Als Grundlage der Berücksichtigung von Atembewegungen während der Therapie kommen zunehmend Verfahren zur 4D(=3D+t)-CT-Bildgebung zum Einsatz. Deren Integration in den klinischen Workflow bedarf aus Sicht der Bildverarbeitung zweier zentraler Schritte: einer bildbasierten Abschätzung der Organ- und Tumorbewegungen sowie der Berücksichtigung der geschätzten Bewegungen während der Dosisberechnung im Sinne einer Dosisakkumulation. Unter Rückgriff auf Verfahren zur nicht-linearen Registrierung entwickelt, evaluiert und optimiert René Werner zunächst Ansätze zur patientenspezifischen Bewegungsfeldschätzung und statistischen Bewegungsmodellierung. Hierauf aufbauend leitet er Schemata für eine präzise Dosisakkumulation her und setzt diese zur Untersuchung der Auswirkungen atmungsbedingter Bewegungen in der Strahlentherapie von Lungentumoren ein. Der Inhalt·         Strahlentherapie·         4D-CT-Bilddaten·         Bewegungsfeldschätzung·         Nicht-lineare Registrierung·         4D-Dosisberechnung·         Dosisakkumulation Die Zielgruppen·         Dozierende und Studierende der Medizintechnik mit den Schwerpunkten Bildgebung, Bildverarbeitung, Medizinische Informatik, Medizinische Physik·         Strahlentherapeuten, Medizinische Physiker  Der Autor Dr. rer. nat.

Beim Bau und Betrieb öffentlicher Hochbauten muss der Staat eine Vorbildfunktion einnehmen. Aufgrund der anhaltenden defizitären Haushaltslage der öffentlichen Hand gewinnt die alternative Beschaffungsvariante Öffentlich-Private Partnerschaften zunehmend an Bedeutung. Robin Heidel zeigt auf, wie ÖPP-Hochbauprojekte gestaltet werden müssen, damit ein energieeffizienter Betrieb sichergestellt wird. Er entwickelt dazu ein Referenz­modell mit Prozessbeschreibungen für die einzelnen Projektphasen. Anhand eines Praxisbeispiels stellt er den möglichen Nutzen des Modells dar. Der Inhalt·         Grundlagen von ÖPP, öffentlichem Hochbau und Energiemanagement·         Relevanz des Energiemanagements bei ÖPP·         Entwicklung eines Referenzmodells·         Modellüberprüfung am Praxisbeispiel Die Zielgruppen·         Dozierende und Studierende des Bau- und Wirtschaftsingenieurwesens sowie der Architektur·         Fach- und Führungskräfte aus der Bau- und Immobilienwirtschaft, Berater sowie Entscheidungsträger der öffentlichen Hand Der AutorDr. Robin Heidel promovierte bei Univ.-Prof. Dr.-Ing.

The goal of a recommender system is to provide personalized recommendations of products or services to users. With the advent of the Social Web, user-generated content has enriched the social dimension of the Web. As user-provided content data also tells us something about the user, one can learn the user’s individual preferences from the Social Web. This opens up completely new opportunities and challenges for recommender systems research. Fatih Gedikli deals with the question of how user-provided tagging data can be used to build better recommender systems. A tag recommender algorithm is proposed which recommends tags for users to annotate their favorite online resources. The author also proposes algorithms which exploit the user-provided tagging data and produce more accurate recommendations. On the basis of this idea, he shows how tags can be used to explain to the user the automatically generated recommendations in a clear and intuitively understandable form. With his book, Fatih Gedikli gives us an outlook on the next generation of recommendation systems in the Social Web sphere.Contents -  Recommender Systems-  Social Tagging-  Algorithms-  Explanations Target Groups ·         Researchers and students of computer science ·         Computer and web programmers  The Author Dr. Fatih Gedikli is a research assistant in computer science at TU Dortmund, Germany. 0aComputer science. 0aData mining. 0aInformation storage and retrieval systems.14aComputer Science.24aData Mining and Knowledge Discovery.24aInformation Storage and Retrieval.24aUser Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer eBooks08iPrinted edition:z978365801947140uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-658-01948-8  aZDB-2-SCS  aComputer Science (Springer-11645)03419nam a22003735i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001700172072001500189072002300204082001200227100002200239245010900261260008300370300003400453490009000487520198100577650002202558650003602580650002202616650003102638650006202669710003402731773002002765776003602785830009002821856004802911912001402959950007202973978-3-658-01955-6DE-He21320130427043751.0cr nn 008mamaa130427s2013    gw |    s    |||| 0|ger d  a97836580195569978-3-658-01955-67 a10.1007/978-3-658-01955-62doi 4aQA75.5-76.95 7aUY2bicssc 7aCOM0140002bisacsh04a0042231 aKeßler, Steffen.10aAnpassung von Open-Source-Software in Anwenderunternehmenh[electronic resource] /cvon Steffen Keßler.  aWiesbaden :bSpringer Fachmedien Wiesbaden :bImprint: Springer Vieweg,c2013.  aXIX, 209 S. 29 Abb.bdigital.0 aEntwicklung und Management von Informationssystemen und intelligenter Datenauswertung  aOpen-Source-Software (OSS) wird heute von fast allen privaten Nutzern, Unternehmungen und öffentlichen Organisationen genutzt. Da sie einen offenen Quellcode besitzt, kann jeder Nutzer OSS unter gegebenen Lizenzbedingungen auf seine eigenen Bedürfnisse zuschneiden bzw. anpassen. Eine Anpassung von OSS erfolgt jedoch nur selten. Steffen Keßler zeigt verschiedene Ursachen dafür auf und entwickelt ein Prozessmodell für die Anpassung von OSS in Anwenderunternehmen. Basierend darauf leitet er besondere Anforderungen an das Konfigurations- und Änderungsmanagement ab und strukturiert die möglichen Zustandsübergänge der Software-Quelltexte. Im Anschluss prüft er, in welchem Umfang gängige Steuerungsmodelle für das Management von Softwareentwicklung und -einsatz, z. B. COBIT oder der Standard ISO/IEC 15504, die Anpassung von OSS unterstützen können. Sein Prozessmodell kann das Management der OSS-Anpassung effektiv unterstützen und damit die Komplexität, die aus der Anpassung resultiert, beherrschbar machen. Der Inhalt·         Open-Source-Software (OSS)·         Softwarelebenszyklus und Softwareevolution·         Untersuchung der internen Anpassung von OSS in einem Praxisprojekt·         Prozess der Anpassung von OSS in Unternehmen·         Anpassung von OSS und Best-Practice-Frameworks Die Zielgruppen·         Wissenschaftler und Studierende auf dem Gebiet der Wirtschaftsinformatik·         (Wirtschafts-)InformatikerInnen in Anwenderunternehmen  Der Autor Dr. Steffen Keßler promovierte bei Prof. Dr. Paul Alpar am Institut für Wirtschaftsinformatik der Philipps-Universität Marburg.

Sein Ziel ist die Steigerung des Receiverwirkungsgrades und das Aufzeigen und Bewerten kritischer Aspekte von innovativen Receivertechnologien. Zunächst erfolgt eine Konzeptstudie, die dazu dient, den Stand der Technik der Solarturmkraftwerke mit ausgewählten Receiveroptionen für die Erhöhung der Dampfprozesstemperaturen zu vergleichen. Diese Studie zeigt, dass die Direktabsorption auf der inneren Mantelfläche des Receivers mit nach unten geöffneter Apertur und Flüssigfilmkühlung die höchsten Potenziale zwischen den verglichenen Optionen aufweist. Daraufhin erfolgt die detaillierte strömungsmechanische und thermodynamische Modellbildung dieses Receiverkonzepts im Maßstab 1:1, mit der die Analyse der Machbarkeit und der Funktionalität erfolgt. Der Inhalt·         Konzepte zur solarthermischen Stromerzeugung·         Modellbildung und Betriebsstrategien für innen liegende Direktabsorption·         IDAR-Leitkonzept, Betriebskriterien, Analyse des Betriebsverhaltens·         Drei-Jahres-Ergebnisse, Kostenrechnung Die Zielgruppen·         Dozierende und Studierende des Maschinenbaus, der Energietechnik, Verfahrenstechnik, Politik, Sozialwissenschaften, Umweltwissenschaften und Wirtschaftswissenschaften, die sich mit regenerativen Energien, insbesondere mit Solarthermie (CSP), auseinandersetzen.·         Ingenieure in Unternehmen sowie Fachleute, die sich im Rahmen der Planungsphase der Energiewende mit dem Thema CSP beschäftigen. Der AutorCsaba Singer hat Luft- und Raumfahrttechnik an der Universität Stuttgart studiert und vertiefte seine Kenntnisse im Fachgebiet der Thermodynamik an der University of Exeter.

In recent years, social network research has advanced significantly; the development of sophisticated techniques for Social Network Analysis and Mining (SNAM) has been highly influenced by the online social Web sites, email logs, phone logs and instant messaging systems, which are widely analyzed using graph theory and machine learning techniques. People perceive the Web increasingly as a social medium that fosters interaction among people, sharing of experiences and knowledge, group activities, community formation and evolution. This has led to a rising prominence of SNAM in academia, politics, homeland security and business. This follows the pattern of known entities of our society that have evolved into networks in which actors are increasingly dependent on their structural embedding General areas of interest to the book include information science and mathematics, communication studies, business and organizational studies, sociology, psychology, anthropology, applied linguistics, biology and medicine. 0aComputer science.14aComputer Science.24aComputer Science, general.1 aRokne, Jon.1 aWagner, Gerhard.1 aReuser, Arno H.P.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer eBooks08iPrinted edition:z9783709113455 0aLecture Notes in Social Networks,x2190-5428 ;v640uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-7091-1346-2  aZDB-2-SCS  aComputer Science (Springer-11645)03550nam a22003735i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001600172072001600188072001700204072002300221082001400244100001900258245007400277260005900351300003500410505121600445520117701661650002202838650002202860650005502882650002202937650002702959710003402986773002003020776003603040856004803076912001403124950003803138978-3-7091-1425-4DE-He21320130217122453.0cr nn 008mamaa130109s2013    au |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97837091142549978-3-7091-1425-47 a10.1007/978-3-7091-1425-42doi 4aQA76.76.A65 7aUNH2bicssc 7aUDBD2bicssc 7aCOM0320002bisacsh04a005.72231 aUesugi, Shiro.10aIT Enabled Servicesh[electronic resource] /cedited by Shiro Uesugi.  aVienna :bSpringer Vienna :bImprint: Springer,c2013.  aIX, 247 p. 77 illus.bdigital.0 aIT-Enabled Services -- The Effects Of Similarities To Previous Buyers On Trust And Intention To Buy From E-Commerce Stores: An Experimental Study Based On The Svs Model -- Information Diffusion And Dissipative Effect On Social Networks -- Construction Of An Appropriately Professional Working Environment For It Professionals: A Key Element Of Quality It-Enabled Services -- A Community Based Trust Establishing Mechanism For A Social Web Service -- Smartphones: The Next Generation Medication Administration Tool -- Weaknesses Of The E-Government Development Index -- Computer Mediated Communication And Telecollaboration For Language Learning: Issues Of Technology -- Transforming The Personal Response System To A Cloud Voting Service -- Case Studies Of User Interface Design On Internet Banking Websites And Mobile Payment Applications In Thailand.-   Japanese Students’ Behavior Toward E-Commerce -- Exchange Of Information And Values Taking Privacy Into Consideration -- Real Name Social Networking Services And Risks Of Digital Identity.

Achieving valuable traceability information, however, is especially difficult concerning the transition from requirements to design. Bernhard Turban analyzes systems and software engineering theories cross-cutting the issue (embedded systems development, systems engineering, software engineering, requirements engineering and management, design theory and processes for safety-critical systems). As a solution, the author proposes a new tool approach to support designers in their thinking in order to achieve traceability as a by-product to normal design activities and to extend traceability information with information about design decision rationale. Contents·         Requirement Engineering and Management·         Design Theories·         Quality Standards for Safety-Critical Development Processes·         Rationale Management·         Requirement Traceability·         A Tool Approach for Requirement Traceability between Requirements and Design  Target Groups·         Researchers and students in the fields of requirement traceability, design theory, rationale management, development of safety-critical systems·         Engineers in the fields of requirements engineering, systems engineering, and software engineering of safety-critical systems Author Dr. Bernhard Turban completed his doctoral degree at the Institute for Information and Media, Language and Culture of the University of Regensburg under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Christian Wolff.

Ihre Energie beziehen sie aus der Kurbelwelle, ein effizienter Ventiltrieb trägt dadurch zusätzlich erheblich zur Verbesserung des Gesamtwirkungsgrads bei. Dabei sind die Komponenten des Ventiltriebsystems hohen Belastungen ausgesetzt. Neben dem Verschleiß durch mechanische Kräfte stellen insbesondere die steigenden Verbrennungsdrücke und -temperaturen wachsende Anforderungen an die Werkstoffe und die Wärmeabfuhr bei verbrennungsseitigen Komponenten.

Die äußerst vorteilhafte knotenorientierte Darstellung zieht sich dabei wie ein roter Faden durch das Buch. Schwerpunkte bilden das Rechnen mit Symmetrischen Komponenten im Frequenzbereich auf der Grundlage des klassischen Knotenpunktverfahrens und das Rechnen mit Raumzeigerkomponenten im Zeitbereich auf der Grundlage des neuen Erweiterten Knotenpunktverfahrens. Für die Berechnung beliebiger Fehlerzustände (Kurzschlüsse und Unterbrechungen) wird mit dem Fehlermatrizenverfahren ein neues universelles Verfahren vorgestellt, das gleichermaßen auf die Symmetrischen Komponenten und Raumzeigerkomponenten angewendet werden kann. Zahlreiche durchgerechnete Beispiele und MATLAB Programmcodes für die Leistungsflussberechnung und das Fehlermatrizenverfahren ergänzen die Ausführungen.Die 2. Auflage ist um ein Kapitel zur Netzzustandsidentifikation erweitert. Die Kenntnis des Netzzustandes ist Voraussetzung für eine optimale Betriebsführung und die Beherrschung von Störungen durch Kurzschlüsse und andere Einflüsse. Die Ausführungen zur Berechnung von Kurzschlüssen wurden ergänzt um das Überlagerungsverfahren und die Anwendung des Fehlermatrizenverfahrens beim Gebrauch der Normen IEC und DIN EN 60909-0. Der InhaltSymmetrische Komponenten und Raumzeiger - Mathematische Modelle der Betriebsmittel im Frequenz- und Zeitbereich - Klassisches und Erweitertes Knotenpunktverfahren - Netzgleichungssysteme - Leistungsfluss- und Stabilitätsberechnung - Berechnung von symmetrischen und unsymmetrischen Fehlern - Berechnung von Ausgleichsvorgängen Die ZielgruppenStudierende der Energietechnik an Universitäten und FachhochschulenIngenieure und Anwender aus energietechnischen BereichenInformatiker, Physiker und Mathematiker mit fachübergreifendem Interesse an der Energietechnik Der AutorUniv.-Prof. Dr.-Ing. habil.

Die dargestellten Inhalte und deren Aufbereitung orientieren sich an dem Entwurfsprozess in der Praxis und betten diesen in ein theoretisches Gerüst aus notwendigem Hintergrundwissen ein. Als Einstieg wird ein Überblick über das Verständnis von Stadt, von städtischen Strukturen und den hierin herrschenden Gesetzmäßigkeiten gegeben. Um das vielschichtige Gebilde der Stadt verständlicher zu machen, wird dieses in unterschiedliche Layer und Bausteine zerlegt. Die Vorgehensweise beim Städtebaulichen Entwerfen wird anhand der „Schichten-Methode“ in Form von aufeinander folgenden Phasen beschrieben. Beispiele von städtebaulichen Projekten und Wettbewerben illustrieren die einzelnen Entwurfsschritte.Der InhaltEinführung.- Zum Verständnis der Grundbegriffe.- Ein Streifzug: von der Geschichte zur Theorie.- Die "Grammatik" der Stadt.- Bausteine der Stadt.- Das Lesen der Stadt.- Städtebauliches Entwerfen.- Stadtgestaltung und Haltung.- Städtebau als Prozess.- Ausgewählte Aufgabenfelder.Die ZielgruppenArchitekten, Stadt- und Raumplaner im StudiumDie AutorinProf. Dipl.-Ing.

OTS items allow mastering complexity and reducing costs and time-to-market; however, achieving these goals by ensuring dependability requirements at the same time is challenging. CRITICAL STEP project establishes a strategic collaboration between academic and industrial partners, and proposes a framework to support the development of dependable, OTS-based, critical systems. The book introduces methods and tools adopted by the critical systems industry, and surveys key achievements of the CRITICAL STEP project along four directions: fault injection tools, V&amp;V of critical systems, runtime monitoring and evaluation techniques, and security assessment. 0aComputer science. 0aOperating systems (Computers). 0aSoftware engineering.14aComputer Science.24aPerformance and Reliability.24aSoftware Engineering/Programming and Operating Systems.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer eBooks08iPrinted edition:z978884702771840uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-88-470-2772-5  aZDB-2-SCS  aComputer Science (Springer-11645)02663nam a22004335i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001500172050001500187072001700202072002300219082001600242082001400258100001900272245013200291260005800423300003500481490006600516505019500582520100300777650002201780650002601802650002401828650002201852650005201874650002401926650002301950710003401973773002002007776003602027830006602063856004802129912001402177950003802191978-88-470-5247-5DE-He21320130410041214.0cr nn 008mamaa130410s2013    it |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97888470524759978-88-470-5247-57 a10.1007/978-88-470-5247-52doi 4aQA76.9.U83 4aQA76.9.H85 7aUYZG2bicssc 7aCOM0700002bisacsh04a005.43722304a4.0192231 aUğur, Seçil.10aWearing Embodied Emotionsh[electronic resource] :bA Practice Based Design Research on Wearable Technology /cby Seçil Uğur.  aMilano :bSpringer Milan :bImprint: Springer,c2013.  aXI, 106 p. 19 illus.bdigital.0 aSpringerBriefs in Applied Sciences and Technology,x2191-530X0 aIntroduction -- Human Body’s Extensions -- Emotion, Design and Technology -- A Design Practice on Emotional Embodiment through Wearable Technology -- Prototyping and Testing -- Conclusion.  aToday, people are in an era of digitally mediated Human-to-Human Interaction, which cannot provide full sensorial contact and therefore, emotions cannot be communicated completely. The intimate cover of the human body, i.e. garment is the interface, where many personal traits are embodied. With the improvements in textile and electronics industry, this embodiment can be carried on a higher level, where the garments become dynamic interfaces and extensions of the human body. This book consists of a research on skin, clothes and technology as extensions of human body, emotions, technology-mediated emotions and a design practice that explores the communicative level of wearable technology through turning it into a living surface, which can convert intangible data to tangible in order to provide an emotional communication. This book aims to show how Human-Technology interaction is carried into an alternative context, where technology dissolves in use and starts serving for enhancing HHI. 0aComputer science. 0aArchitectural design. 0aEngineering design.14aComputer Science.24aUser Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction.24aEngineering Design.24aIndustrial Design.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer eBooks08iPrinted edition:z9788847052468 0aSpringerBriefs in Applied Sciences and Technology,x2191-530X40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-88-470-5247-5  aZDB-2-SCS  aComputer Science (Springer-11645)04288nam a22004575i 4500001001800000003000900018005001700027007001500044008004100059020003700100024003500137050001500172072001600187072002300203082001400226100002400240245014400264260006300408300005600471490006500527505096300592520173701555650002203292650002503314650001503339650002503354650002203379650002903401650002703430650004003457650004303497700002103540700001403561710003403575773002003609776003603629830006503665856004803730912001403778950003803792978-94-91216-74-9DE-He21320130220180209.0cr nn 008mamaa130125s2013    fr |    s    |||| 0|eng d  a97894912167499978-94-91216-74-97 a10.2991/978-94-91216-74-92doi 4aQA76.9.C65 7aUGK2bicssc 7aCOM0720002bisacsh04a003.32231 aVitoriano, Begoña.10aDecision Aid Models for Disaster Management and Emergenciesh[electronic resource] /cedited by Begoña Vitoriano, Javier Montero, Da Ruan.  aParis :bAtlantis Press :bImprint: Atlantis Press,c2013.  aXV, 325 p. 58 illus., 32 illus. in color.bdigital.0 aAtlantis Computational Intelligence Systems,x1875-7650 ;v70 aOn the Use of Information in Humanitarian Operations -- Decision Aid Models and Systems for Humanitarian Logistics.

The process may be initiated when anything threatens to disrupt normal operations or puts the lives of human beings at risk. Governments on all levels as well as many businesses create some sort of disaster plan that make it possible to overcome the catastrophe and return to normal function as quickly as possible. Response to natural disasters (e.g., floods, earthquakes) or technological disaster (e.g., nuclear, chemical) is an extreme complex process that involves severe time pressure, various uncertainties, high non-linearity and many stakeholders. Disaster management often requires several autonomous agencies to collaboratively mitigate, prepare, respond, and recover from heterogeneous and dynamic sets of hazards to society. Almost all disasters involve high degrees of novelty to deal with most unexpected various uncertainties and dynamic time pressures. Existing studies and approaches within disaster management have mainly been focused on some specific type of disasters with certain agency oriented. There is a lack of a general framework to deal with similarities and synergies among different disasters by taking their specific features into account. This book provides with various decisions analysis theories and support tools in complex systems in general and in disaster management in particular. The book is also generated during a long-term preparation of a European project proposal among most leading experts in the areas related to the book title. Chapters are evaluated based on quality and originality in theory and methodology, application oriented, relevance to the title of the book. 0aComputer science. 0aComputer simulation. 0aEconomics. 0aOperations research.14aComputer Science.24aSimulation and Modeling.24aComputer Applications.24aOperation Research/Decision Theory.24aEconomics/Management Science, general.1 aMontero, Javier.1 aRuan, Da.2 aSpringerLink (Online service)0 tSpringer eBooks08iPrinted edition:z9789491216732 0aAtlantis Computational Intelligence Systems,x1875-7650 ;v740uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2991/978-94-91216-74-9  aZDB-2-SCS  aComputer Science (Springer-11645)
