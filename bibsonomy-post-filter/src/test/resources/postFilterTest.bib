We outline the requirements and functionalities that were identiﬁed for a useful Semantic Desktop system and present an architecture that fulfills these requirements which was acquired by incremental reﬁnement of the architecture of existing Semantic Desktop prototypes. The NEPOMUK project is primarily motivated by three real-life industrial use-cases, we brieﬂy outline these and the processes used to extract required functionalities from the people working in these areas today, and we present a selection of typical tasks where the Semantic Desktop could be of beneﬁt.},

    abstract = {The Semantic Web promises to open innumerable opportunities for automation and information retrieval by standardizing the protocols for metadata exchange. However, just as the success of the World Wide Web can be attributed to the ease of use and ubiquity of Web browsers, we believe that the unfolding of the Semantic Web vision depends on users getting powerful but easy-to-use tools for managing their information. But unlike HTML, which can be easily edited in any text editor, RDF is more complicated to author and does not have an obvious presentation mechanism. Previous work has concentrated on the ideas of generic RDF graph visualization and RDF Schema-based form generation. In this paper, we present a comprehensive platform for constructing end user applications that create, manipulate, and visualize arbitrary RDF-encoded information, adding another layer to the abstraction cake. We discuss a programming environment specifically designed for manipulating RDF and introduce user interface concepts on top that allow the developer to quickly assemble applications that are based on RDF data models. Also, because user interface specifications and program logic are themselves describable in RDF, applications built upon our framework enjoy properties such as network updatability, extensibility, and end user customizability – all desirable characteristics in the spirit of the Semantic Web.},

A number of questions remain unanswered, however, regarding the nature of collaborative tagging systems including the dynamics of such systems and whether coherent classification schemes can emerge from undirected tagging by users. Currently millions of users are using collaborative tagging without centrally organizing principles, and many suspect this exhibits features considered to be indicative of a complex system. If this is the case, it remains to be seem whether collaborative tagging by users over time leads to emergent classi- fication schemes that could be formalized into an ontology usable by the Semantic Web. This paper uses data from “popular” tagged sites on the social bookmarking site del.icio.us to examine the dynamics of such collaborative tagging systems. In particular, we are trying to determine whether the distribution of tag frequencies stabilizes, which indicates a degree of cohesion or consensus among users about the optimal tags to describe particular sites. We use tag co-occurrence networks for a sample domain of tags to analyze the meaning of particular tags given their relationship to other tags and automatically create an ontology. We also produce a generative model of collaborative tagging in order to model and understand some of the basic dynamics behind the process.},

Here we collect data from a popular system and investigate the statistical properties of tag co-occurrence. We introduce a stochastic model of user behavior embodying two main aspects of collaborative tagging: (i) a frequency-bias mechanism related to the idea that users are exposed to each other's tagging activity; (ii) a notion of memory - or aging of resources - in the form of a heavy-tailed access to the past state of the system. Remarkably, our simple modeling is able to account quantitatively for the observed experimental features, with a surprisingly high accuracy. This points in the direction of a universal behavior of users, who - despite the complexity of their own cognitive processes and the uncoordinated and selfish nature of their tagging activity - appear to follow simple activity patterns. },

We study the temporal evolution of the global vocabulary size, i.e. the number of distinct tags in the entire system, as well as the evolution of local vocabularies, that is the growth of the number of distinct tags used in the context of a given resource or user. In both cases, we find power-law behaviors with exponents smaller than one. Surprisingly, the observed growth behaviors are remarkably regular throughout the entire history of the system and across very different resources being bookmarked. Similar sub-linear laws of growth have been observed in written text, and this qualitative universality calls for an explanation and points in the direction of non-trivial cognitive processes in the complex interaction patterns characterizing collaborative tagging. },

However, it is unknown if online relationships and their growth patterns are the same as in real-life social networks. In this paper, we compare the structures of three online social networking services: Cyworld, MySpace, and orkut, each with more than 10 million users, respectively. We have access to complete data of Cyworld's ilchon (friend) relationships and analyze its degree distribution, clustering property, degree correlation, and evolution over time. We also use Cyworld data to evaluate the validity of snowball sampling method, which we use to crawl and obtain partial network topologies of MySpace and orkut. Cyworld, the oldest of the three, demonstrates a changing scaling behavior over time in degree distribution. The latest Cyworld data's degree distribution exhibits a multi-scaling behavior, while those of MySpace and orkut have simple scaling behaviors with different exponents. Very interestingly, each of the two e ponents corresponds to the different segments in Cyworld's degree distribution. Certain online social networking services encourage online activities that cannot be easily copied in real life; we show that they deviate from close-knit online social networks which show a similar degree correlation pattern to real-life social networks.},

A first step towards this end is to gain better insights into content and structure of these systems. In this paper, we will analyse the main network characteristics of two of these systems. We consider their underlying data structures - so-called folksonomies - as tri-partite hypergraphs, and adapt classical network measures like characteristic path length and clustering coefficient to them.

Subsequently, we introduce a network of tag co-occurrence and investigate some of its statistical properties, focusing on correlations in node connectivity and pointing out features that reflect emergent semantics within the folksonomy. We show that simple statistical indicators unambiguously spot non-social behavior such as spam.

    abstract = {  The enormous increase of popularity and use of the WWW has led in the recent
years to important changes in the ways people communicate. An interesting
example of this fact is provided by the now very popular social annotation
systems, through which users annotate resources (such as web pages or digital
photographs) with text keywords dubbed tags. Understanding the rich emerging
structures resulting from the uncoordinated actions of users calls for an
interdisciplinary effort. In particular concepts borrowed from statistical
physics, such as random walks, and the complex networks framework, can
effectively contribute to the mathematical modeling of social annotation
systems. Here we show that the process of social annotation can be seen as a
collective but uncoordinated exploration of an underlying semantic space,
pictured as a graph, through a series of random walks. This modeling framework
reproduces several aspects, so far unexplained, of social annotation, among
which the peculiar growth of the size of the vocabulary used by the community
and its complex network structure that represents an externalization of
semantic structures grounded in cognition and typically hard to access.

	abstract = {Recent growth of social classification systems due to steadily increasing popularity has established a multitude of heterogeneous isolated, non-integrated, and non-interoperable tag spaces. Contrary to current research predominantly focusing on single folksonomies, we exploit cross-space similarities to improve a variety of tagging use cases beyond the limits of one folksonomy. This paper presents the results of practical studies concerning cross-space analysis of (co-)tag spaces of five well-established social classification services for tagging of bookmarks (del.icio.us, BibSonomy bookmarks), and publications (BibSonomy publications, CiteULike, Connotea). The studies are based on one month data sets of RSS recent feeds from the same time scope. We provide a profound motivation for cross-space tagging, and give insight into similarities and intersections of (top ranking) (co-)tag spaces as well as convergence aspects over time.},

In this work, we show how an adversary can exploit an online social network with a mixture of public and private user profiles to predict the private attributes of users. We map this problem to a relational classification problem and we propose practical models that use friendship and group membership information (which is often not hidden) to infer sensitive attributes. The key novel idea is that in addition to friendship links, groups can be carriers of significant information. We show that on several well-known social media sites, we can easily and accurately recover the information of private-profile users. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that uses link-based and group-based classification to study privacy implications in social networks with mixed public and private user profiles.},

The idea for a user trial started after Marten Hoekstra of the SNE group contacted the University Library of the University of Amsterdam for advice and recommendation on using one of the academic social referencing tools. The University Library recognized the value of the social bookmarking site Del.icio.us, but concluded that this was not optimal for academic work1. Three other academic social referencing software tools were identified and analysed. Possible advantages of these academic social referencing tools for academics are listed in the textbox below. 
In order to assess the potential value of Web 2.0 applications for library services, and specifically academic social referencing tools, a user trial was set up by the University library with the members of the SNE group. Pleiade Management and Consultancy was asked to document and report the feedback from the users during the trial. The user trial was supervised by Driek van Heesakkers of the University library and Marten Hoekstra of the SNE group.

    abstract = {Collaborative tagging has recently attracted the attention of both industry and academia due to the popularity of content-sharing systems such as CiteULike, del.icio.us, and Flickr. These systems give users the opportunity to add data items and to attach their own metadata (or tags) to stored data. The result is an effective content management tool for individual users. Recent studies, however, suggest that, as tagging communities grow, the added content and the metadata become harder to manage due to an ease in content diversity. Thus, mechanisms that cope with increase of diversity are fundamental to improve the scalability and usability of collaborative tagging systems. This paper analyzes whether usage patterns can be harnessed to improve navigability in a growing knowledge space. To this end, it presents a characterization of two collaborative tagging communities that target scientific literature: CiteULike and Bibsonomy. We explore three main directions: First, we analyze the tagging activity distribution across the user population. Second, we define new metrics for similarity in user interest and use these metrics to uncover the structure of the tagging communities we study. The structure we uncover suggests a clear segmentation of interests into a large number of individuals with unique preferences and a core set of users with interspersed interests. Finally, we offer preliminary results that demonstrate that the interest-based structure of the tagging community can be used to facilitate content usage as communities scale. },

uncontrolled resource organization paradigm has led to a large number of 
research activities focussing on a formal description and analysis of the 
resulting "folksonomies". An interesting outcome is that the characteristic 
qualities of these systems seem to be inverse to more traditional knowledge 
structuring approaches like taxonomies or ontologies: The latter provide rich 
and precise semantics, but suffer - amongst others - from a knowledge 
acquisition bottleneck. An important step towards exploiting the possible 
synergies by bridging the gap between both paradigms is the automatic 
extraction of relations between tags in a folksonomy. This position paper 
presents preliminary results of ongoing work to induce hierarchical 
relationships among tags by analyzing the aggregated data of collaborative 
tagging systems as a basis for an ontology learning procedure.

These systems, especially the k-nearest neighbor collaborative filtering based ones, are achieving widespread success on the Web. The tremendous growth in the amount of available information and the number of visitors to Web sites in recent years poses some key challenges for recommender systems. These are: producing high quality recommendations, performing many recommendations per second for millions of users and items and achieving high coverage in the face of data sparsity. In traditional collaborative filtering systems the amount of work increases with the number of participants in the system. New recommender system technologies are needed that can quickly produce high quality recommendations, even for very large-scale problems. To address these issues we have explored item-based collaborative filtering techniques. Item-based techniques first analyze the user-item matrix to identify relationships between different items, and then use these relationships to indirectly compute recommendations for users.
In this paper we analyze different item-based recommendation generation algorithms. We look into different techniques for computing item-item similarities (e.g., item-item correlation vs. cosine similarities between item vectors) and different techniques for obtaining recommendations from them (e.g., weighted sum vs. regression model). Finally, we experimentally evaluate our results and compare them to the basic k-nearest neighbor approach. Our experiments suggest that item-based algorithms provide dramatically better performance than user-based algorithms, while at the same time providing better quality than the best available user-based algorithms.},

In this paper we present TagFS, a filesystem with tagging support which aims at a seamless integration of the tagging paradigm with local applications. While retaining the notions of directories and files and providing all standard filesystem operations, the semantics of these primitives are changed to modifications of the tag annotations.},

There has still been some confusion, which is very understandable as it is a different concept that goes beyond a simple understanding of tagging. I have put together a couple graphics that should help provide a means to make this distinction some what clearer. The folksonomy is a means for people to tag objects (web pages, photos, videos, podcasts, etc., essentially anything that is internet addressable) using their own vocabulary so that it is easy for them to refind that information again. The folksonomy is most often also social so that others that use the same vocabulary will be able to find the object as well. It is important to note that folksonomies work best when the tags used to describe objects are in the common vocabulary and not what a person perceives others will call it (the tool works like no other for personal information management of information on the web, but is also shared with the world to help others find the information).},

These were cluster analyzed and a taxonomy of 30 goal clusters was developed for each age group separately and for the total sample. The clusters were conceptually meaningful and consistent across the 3 samples. The broadest distinction in each sample was between interpersonal or social goals and intrapersonal or individual goals, with interpersonal goals divided into family-related and more general social goals. Further, the 30 clusters were organized into meaningful higher order clusters. The role of such a taxonomy in promoting theory development and research is discussed, as is its relationship to other organizations of human goals and to the Big Five structure of personality.

Our analysis is based on a corpus of search keywords, contents, titles, and tags applied to several thousand popular Web pages. Among other results, we find that the more popular tags of a page tend to be the more meaningful ones. For (2), we develop a model of how the influence of tag suggestions can be measured. From a user study with over 4,000 participants, we conclude that roughly one third of the tag applications may be induced by the suggestions. Our results would be of interest for designers of social tagging systems and are a step towards understanding how to best leverage social tags for applications such as search and information extraction.},

part of the Web 2.0. In such systems
users describe bookmarks by keywords
called tags. The structure behind these social
systems, called folksonomies, can be viewed
as a tripartite hypergraph of user, tag and resource
nodes. This underlying network shows
specific structural properties that explain its
growth and the possibility of serendipitous
exploration.
Today’s search engines represent the gateway
to retrieve information from the World Wide
Web. Short queries typically consisting of
two to three words describe a user’s information
need. In response to the displayed
results of the search engine, users click on
the links of the result page as they expect
the answer to be of relevance.
This clickdata can be represented as a folksonomy
in which queries are descriptions of
clicked URLs. The resulting network structure,
which we will term logsonomy is very
similar to the one of folksonomies. In order
to find out about its properties, we analyze
the topological characteristics of the tripartite
hypergraph of queries, users and bookmarks
on a large snapshot of del.icio.us and
on query logs of two large search engines.
All of the three datasets show small world
properties. The tagging behavior of users,
which is explained by preferential attachment
of the tags in social bookmark systems, is
reflected in the distribution of single query
words in search engines. We can conclude
that the clicking behaviour of search engine
users based on the displayed search results
and the tagging behaviour of social bookmarking
users is driven by similar dynamics.},

The problem becomes more severe with the increasing fraction of multimedia data, from which it is difficult to extract some conceptual description of their contents.

One way to overcome this problem are social bookmark tools, which are rapidly emerging on the web. In such systems, users are setting up lightweight conceptual structures called folksonomies, and overcome thus the knowledge acquisition bottleneck. As more and more people participate in the effort, the use of a common vocabulary becomes more and more stable. We present an approach for discovering topic-specific trends within folksonomies. It is based on a differential adaptation of the PageRank algorithm to the triadic hypergraph structure of a folksonomy. The approach allows for any kind of data, as it does not rely on the internal structure of the documents. In particular, this allows to consider different data types in the same analysis step. We run experiments on a large-scale real-world snapshot of a social bookmarking system.},

Some applications may rank a swarm's nodes by their relative importance, for example, using the PageRank algorithm applied in certain search engines to order query responses. The PageRank values of the nodes correspond to a unique eigenvector that can be computed using the power method, an iterative technique based on matrix multiplication. The first result is a practical lower bound on the PageRank algorithm's execution time that is derived by applying assumptions to the PageRank perturbation's scaling value and the PageRank vector's required numerical precision. The second result establishes nodes contained in the same block of the graph's coarsest equitable partition must have equal PageRank values. The third result, the AverageRank algorithm, ensures such nodes are assigned equal PageRank values. The fourth result, the ProductRank algorithm, reduces the time needed to find the PageRank vector by eliminating certain dot products in the power method if the graph's coarsest equitable partition contains blocks composed of multiple vertices. The fifth result, the QuotientRank algorithm, uses a quotient matrix induced by the coarsest equitable partition to further reduce the time needed to compute a swarm's PageRank vector.},

interesting phases of evolution: from structured directories to
unstructured Web search engines and more recently, to tagging
as a way for aggregating information, a step towards the
semantic web vision. Tagging allows ranking and data
organization to directly utilize inputs from end users, enabling
machine processing of Web content. Since tags are created by
individual users in a free form, one important problem facing
tagging is to identify most appropriate tags, while eliminating
noise and spam. For this purpose, we define a set of general
criteria for a good tagging system. These criteria include high
coverage of multiple facets to ensure good recall, least effort to
reduce the cost involved in browsing, and high popularity to
ensure tag quality. We propose a collaborative tag suggestion
algorithm using these criteria to spot high-quality tags. The
proposed algorithm employs a goodness measure for tags derived
from collective user authorities to combat spam. The goodness
measure is iteratively adjusted by a reward-penalty algorithm,
which also incorporates other sources of tags, e.g., content-based
auto-generated tags. Our experiments based on My Web 2.0 show
that the algorithm is effective.},

Currently, a major obstacle for evaluating recommendation algorithms is the lack of any standard, public, real-world testbed appropriate for the task. In an attempt to fill this gap, we have created REFEREE, a framework for building recommender systems using ResearchIndex--a huge online digital library of computer science research papers--so that anyone in the research community can develop, deploy, and evaluate recommender systems relatively easily and quickly. Research Index is in many ways ideal for evaluating recommender systems, especially so-called hybrid recommenders that combine information filtering and collaborative filtering techniques. The documents in the database are associated with a wealth of content information (author, title, abstract, full text) and collaborative information (user behaviors), as well as linkage information via the citation structure. Our framework supports more realistic evaluation metrics that assess user buy-in directly, rather than resorting to offline metrics like prediction accuracy that may have little to do with end user utility. The sheer scale of ResearchIndex (over 500,000 documents with thousands of user accesses per hour) will force algorithm designers to make real-world trade-offs that consider performance, not just accuracy. We present our own tradeoff decisions in building an example hybrid recommender called PD-Live. The algorithm uses content-based similarity information to select a set of documents from which to recommend, and collaborative information to rank the documents. PD-Live performs reasonably well compared to other recommenders in ResearchIndex.},

Unlike taxonomies, which overimpose a hierarchical categorisation of content, folksonomies empower end users by enabling them to freely create and choose the categories (in this case, tags) that best describe some content. However, as tags are informally defined, continually changing, and ungoverned, social tagging has often been criticised for lowering, rather than increasing, the efficiency of searching, due to the number of synonyms, homonyms, polysemy, as well as the heterogeneity of users and the noise they introduce. In this paper, we propose Social Ranking, a method that exploits recommender system techniques to increase the efficiency of searches within Web 2.0. We measure users' similarity based on their past tag activity. We infer tags' relationships based on their association to content. We then propose a mechanism to answer a user's query that ranks (recommends) content based on the inferred semantic distance of the query to the tags associated to such content, weighted by the similarity of the querying user to the users who created those tags. A thorough evaluation conducted on the CiteULike dataset demonstrates that Social Ranking neatly improves coverage, while not compromising on accuracy.},

The complex network created by many annotations, often called a folksonomy, permits users the freedom to explore tags, resources or even other user's profiles unbound from a rigid predefined conceptual hierarchy. However, the freedom afforded users comes at a cost: an uncontrolled vocabulary can result in tag redundancy and ambiguity hindering navigation. Data mining techniques, such as clustering, provide a means to remedy these problems by identifying trends and reducing noise. Tag clusters can also be used as the basis for effective personalized recommendation assisting users in navigation. We present a personalization algorithm for recommendation in folksonomies which relies on hierarchical tag clusters. Our basic recommendation framework is independent of the clustering method, but we use a context-dependent variant of hierarchical agglomerative clustering which takes into account the user's current navigation context in cluster selection. We present extensive experimental results on two real world dataset. While the personalization algorithm is successful in both cases, our results suggest that folksonomies encompassing only one topic domain, rather than many topics, present an easier target for recommendation, perhaps because they are more focused and often less sparse. Furthermore, context dependent cluster selection, an integral step in our personalization algorithm, demonstrates more utility for recommendation in multi-topic folksonomies than in single-topic folksonomies. This observation suggests that topic selection is an important strategy for recommendation in multi-topic folksonomies.},

Each atomic and composite service is associated with metrics, such as cost, duration, and enjoyment ranking. The framework is based on the Composite Recommender Knowledge Base, which is composed of views, including Service Metric Views that specify services and their metrics; Recommendation Views that specify the ranking definition to balance optimality and diversity; parametric Transformers that specify how service metrics are defined in terms of metrics of its subservices; and learning sets from which the unknown parameters in the transformers are iteratively learned. Also introduced in the paper is the top-k selection criterion that, based on a vector of utility metrics, provides the balance between the optimality of individual metrics and the diversity of recommendations. To exemplify the framework, specific views are developed for a travel package recommender system.},

	abstract = {We study the problem of personalized, interactive tag recommendation for Flickr: While a user enters/selects new tags for a particular picture, the system suggests related tags to her, based on the tags that she or other people have used in the past along with (some of) the tags already entered. The suggested tags are dynamically updated with every additional tag entered/selected. We describe a new algorithm, called Hybrid, which can be applied to this problem, and show that it outperforms previous algorithms. It has only a single tunable parameter, which we found to be very robust.

Apart from this new algorithm and its detailed analysis, our main contributions are (i) a clean methodology which leads to conservative performance estimates, (ii) showing how classical classification algorithms can be applied to this problem, (iii) introducing a new cost measure, which captures the effort of the whole tagging process, (iv) clearly identifying, when purely local schemes (using only a user's tagging history) can or cannot be improved by global schemes (using everybody's tagging history).},

In this paper we go back to basics to address the question directly. We believe that the answer can best be understood in terms of five important and distinctly different roles that a representation plays, each of which places different and at times conflicting demands on the properties a representation should have.

We argue that keeping in mind all five of these roles provides a usefully broad perspective that sheds light on some longstanding disputes and can invigorate both research and practice in the field. },

This paper presents an overview of pattern clustering methods from a statistical pattern recognition perspective, with a goal of providing useful advice and references to fundamental concepts accessible to the broad community of clustering practitioners.

We find that while search is directly involved in a surprisingly small fraction of user clicks, it leads to a much larger fraction of all sites visited. The temporal traffic patterns display strong regularities, with a large portion of future requests being statistically predictable by past ones. Given the importance of topological measures such as PageRank in modeling user navigation, as well as their role in ranking sites for Web search, we use the traffic data to validate the PageRank random surfing model. The ranking obtained by the actual frequency with which a site is visited by users differs significantly from that approximated by the uniform surfing/teleportation behavior modeled by PageRank, especially for the most important sites. To interpret this finding, we consider each of the fundamental assumptions underlying PageRank and show how each is violated by actual user behavior},

Tags are used for navigation, finding resources and serendipitous browsing and thus provide an immediate benefit for users. These systems usually include tag recommendation mechanisms easing the process of finding good tags for a resource, but also consolidating the tag vocabulary across users. In practice, however, only very basic recommendation strategies are applied.
In this paper we evaluate and compare several recommendation algorithms on large-scale real life datasets: an adaptation of
user-based collaborative filtering, a graph-based recommender built on top of the FolkRank algorithm, and simple methods based on counting tag occurences.  We show that both FolkRank and Collaborative Filtering provide better results than non-personalized baseline methods. Moreover, since methods based on counting tag occurrences are computationally cheap, and thus usually preferable for real time scenarios, we discuss simple approaches for improving the performance of such methods. We show, how a simple recommender based on counting tags from users and resources can perform almost as good as the best recommender.

	abstract = {Social bookmarking tools are rapidly emerging on the Web. In such systems users are setting up lightweight conceptual structures called folksonomies. Unlike ontologies, shared conceptualizations are not formalized, but rather implicit. We present a new data mining task, the mining of all frequent tri-concepts, together with an efficient algorithm, for discovering these implicit shared conceptualizations. Our approach extends the data mining task of discovering all closed itemsets to three-dimensional data structures to allow for mining folksonomies. We provide a formal definition of the problem, and present an efficient algorithm for its solution. Finally, we show the applicability of our approach on three large real-world examples.},

	abstract = {OntoClean is an approach towards the formal evaluation of taxonomic relations in ontologies. The application of OntoClean consists of two main steps. First, concepts are tagged according to meta-properties known as rigidity, unity, dependency and identity. Second, the tagged concepts are checked according to predefined constraints to discover taxonomic errors. Although OntoClean is well documented in numerous publications, it is still used rather infrequently due to the high costs of application. Especially, the manual tagging of concepts with the correct meta-properties requires substantial efforts of highly experienced ontology engineers. In order to facilitate the use of OntoClean and to enable the evaluation of real-world ontologies, we provide AEON, a tool which automatically tags concepts with appropriate OntoClean meta-properties and performs the constraint checking. We use the Web as an embodiment of world knowledge, where we search for patterns that indicate how to properly tag concepts. We thoroughly evaluated our approach against a manually created gold standard. The evaluation shows the competitiveness of our approach while at the same time significantly lowering the costs. All of our results, i.e. the tool AEON as well as the experiment data, are publicly available.},

    abstract = {Social bookmarking systems allow users to organise collections of resources on the Web in a collaborative fashion. The increasing popularity of these systems as well as first insights into their emergent semantics have made them relevant to disciplines like knowledge extraction and ontology learning. The problem of devising methods to measure the semantic relatedness between tags and characterizing it semantically is still largely open. Here we analyze three measures of tag relatedness: tag co-occurrence, cosine similarity of co-occurrence distributions, and FolkRank, an adaptation of the PageRank algorithm to folksonomies. Each measure is computed on tags from a large-scale dataset crawled from the social bookmarking system del.icio.us. To provide a semantic grounding of our findings, a connection to WordNet (a semantic lexicon for the English language) is established by mapping tags into synonym sets of WordNet, and applying there well-known metrics of semantic similarity. Our results clearly expose different characteristics of the selected measures of relatedness, making them applicable to different subtasks of knowledge extraction such as synonym detection or discovery of concept hierarchies.},

Recommender systems do, however, suffer from cold-start problems where no initial information is available early on upon which to base recommendations. Semantic knowledge structures, such as ontologies, can provide valuable domain knowledge and user information. However, acquiring such knowledge and keeping it up to date is not a trivial task and user interests are particularly difficult to acquire and maintain. This paper investigates the synergy between a web-based research paper recommender system and an ontology containing information automatically extracted from departmental databases available on the web. The ontology is used to address the recommender systems cold-start problem. The recommender system addresses the ontology's interest-acquisition problem. An empirical evaluation of this approach is conducted and the performance of the integrated systems measured.},

    description = {Welcome to IEEE Xplore 2.0: Building a recommender agent for e-learning systems},
	abstract = { A recommender system in an e-learning context is a software agent that tries to "intelligently" recommend actions to a learner based on the actions of previous learners. This recommendation could be an on-line activity such as doing an exercise, reading posted messages on a conferencing system, or running an on-line simulation, or could be simply a web resource. These recommendation systems have been tried in e-commerce to entice purchasing of goods, but haven't been tried in e-learning. This paper suggests the use of web mining techniques to build such an agent that could recommend on-line learning activities or shortcuts in a course web site based on learners' access history to improve course material navigation as well as assist the online learning process. These techniques are considered integrated web mining as opposed to off-line web mining used by expert users to discover on-line access patterns.},

In this chapter, we describe an online learning system — QSIA — an active recommender system for Questions Sharing and Interactive Assignments, designed to enhance knowledge sharing among learners. First, we lay out some of the theoretical background for social, open-rating mechanisms in online learning systems. We discuss concepts such as social versus black-box recommendations and the advice of neighbors as opposed to that of friends. We argue that enabling subjective views and ratings of other users is an inevitable phase of social collaboration systems. We also argue that social recommendations are critical for the exploitation of the value associated with recommendation.},

	abstract = {Personalized service is important on the Internet, especially in Web-based learning. Generally, most personalized systems consider learner preferences, interests, and browsing behaviors in providing personalized services. However, learner ability usually is neglected as an important factor in implementing personalization mechanisms. Besides, too many hyperlink structures in Web-based learning systems place a large information burden on learners. Consequently, in Web-based learning, disorientation (losing in hyperspace), cognitive overload, lack of an adaptive mechanism, and information overload are the main research issues. This study proposes a personalized e-learning system based on Item Response Theory (PEL-IRT) which considers both course material difficulty and learner ability to provide individual learning paths for learners. The item characteristic function proposed by Rasch with a single difficulty parameter is used to model the course materials. To obtain more precise estimation of learner ability, the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is applied to estimate learner ability based on explicit learner feedback. Moreover, to determine an appropriate level of difficulty parameter for the course materials, this study also proposes a collaborative voting approach for adjusting course material difficulty. Experiment results show that applying Item Response Theory (IRT) to Web-based learning can achieve personalized learning and help learners to learn more effectively and efficiently.},

	abstract = {Clustering is a common technique for the analysis of large images.
In this paper a new approach to hierarchical clustering of very large
data sets is presented. The GRIDCLUS algorithm uses a multidimensional
grid data structure to organize the value space surrounding the pattern
values, rather than to organize the patterns themselves. The patterns
are grouped into blocks and clustered with respect to the blocks by a
topological neighbor search algorithm. The runtime behavior of the
algorithm outperforms all conventional hierarchical methods. A
comparison of execution times to those of other commonly used clustering
algorithms, and a heuristic runtime analysis are presented},

communities, making the task of knowledge contribution more attractive to a
broader audience of Web users. In particular, social bookmarking systems have
shifted the organization of bookmarks from an individual activity performed on
a personal desktop to a collective endeavor over the Web. In such a context,
suggestive tagging has proved to be helpful in consolidating the usage of tags,
leading to a quick convergence to a folksonomy.
In a social bookmarking system, users' annotations can be regarded as a reliable
indicator of interests and preferences. A recommender system is able to learn
user interests and preferences during the interaction in order to construct a user
profile.
In this paper, we propose a smart tag recommender able to learn from past user
interaction as well as the content of the resources to annotate. The aim of the
system is to support users of current social bookmarking systems by providing a
list of new meaningful tags. The proposed system is based on ITem
Recommender, a content-based recommender previously used in a Digital
Library scenario.},

	abstract = {Recommender Systems (RS) aim at predicting items or ratings of items that the user are interested in. Collaborative Filtering (CF) algorithms such as user- and item-based methods are the dominant techniques applied in RS algorithms. To improve recommendation quality, metadata such as content information of items has typically been used as additional knowledge. With the increasing popularity of the collaborative tagging systems, tags could be interesting and useful information to enhance RS algorithms. Unlike attributes which are "global" descriptions of items, tags are "local" descriptions of items given by the users. To the best of our knowledge, there hasn't been any prior study on tag-aware RS. In this paper, we propose a generic method that allows tags to be incorporated to standard CF algorithms, by reducing the three-dimensional correlations to three two-dimensional correlations and then applying a fusion method to re-associate these correlations. Additionally, we investigate the effect of incorporating tags information to different CF algorithms. Empirical evaluations on three CF algorithms with real-life data set demonstrate that incorporating tags to our proposed approach provides promising and significant results.},

Information got from social bookmarking websites not only tells what a user likes, but also why he or she likes it. This paper proposes a division algorithm and a CubeSVD algorithm to analysis this information, distill the interrelations between different usersâ various interests, and make better personalized recommendation based on them.

	abstract = {Collaborative tagging, i.e. the process of assigning metadata in the form of keywords to shared content by many users, has emerged as an important way to provide information about resources on the Web and elsewhere. Such keywords (tags) are used to enable the organization of information within personal information spaces, such as photo collections, but can also be shared, allowing browsing and searching with the help of tags attached by other users to information resources from the Web. Recent research has shown that such tag distributions stabilize over time and can be used to improve search on the Web. In this paper we are interested in another aspect, namely how they characterize the user and enable personalized recommendations. Using data from a frequently used music search portal, Last.fm, we analyze tag usage and statistics and investigate the use of tag-based user profiles in contrast to conventional user profiles based on song and track usage. We specify recommendation algorithms based on tag user profiles, and explore how collaborative filtering recommendations based on these tag profiles are different from recommendations based on song/track profiles. Finally, we describe a new search-based method, which uses tags to recommend songs interesting to a user, yielding substantially improved results. The paper finishes with a discussion of some future work to further improve tag-based search and recommendation in community web sites.},

Most current browsers offer a facility to store and manage bookmarks in a hierarchy of folders; though, with growing size, users reportedly have trouble to create and maintain a stable taxonomy. This paper presents a novel collaborative approach to ease bookmark management, especially the “classification” of new bookmarks into a folder. We propose a methodology to realize the collaborative classification idea of considering how similar users have classified a bookmark. A combination of nearest-neighbour-classifiers is used to derive a recommendation from similar users on where to store a new bookmark. Additionally, a procedure to generate keyword recommendations is proposed to ease the annotation of new bookmarks. A prototype system called CariBo has been implemented as a plugin of the central bookmark server software SiteBar. A case study conducted with real user data supports the validity of the approach.},

Design/methodology/approach - The paper reviews the related literature and discusses some of the problems associated with, and the potential of, collaborative tagging approaches for knowledge organisation and general resource discovery. A definition of controlled vocabularies is proposed and used to assess the efficacy of collaborative tagging. An exposition of the collaborative tagging model is provided and a review of the major contributions to the tagging literature is presented. Findings - There are numerous difficulties with collaborative tagging systems (e.g. low precision, lack of collocation, etc.) that originate from the absence of properties that characterise controlled vocabularies. However, such systems can not be dismissed. Librarians and information professionals have lessons to learn from the interactive and social aspects exemplified by collaborative tagging systems, as well as their success in engaging users with information management. The future co-existence of controlled vocabularies and collaborative tagging is predicted, with each appropriate for use within distinct information contexts: formal and informal. Research limitations/implications - Librarians and information professional researchers should be playing a leading role in research aimed at assessing the efficacy of collaborative tagging in relation to information storage, organisation, and retrieval, and to influence the future development of collaborative tagging systems. Practical implications - The paper indicates clear areas where digital libraries and repositories could innovate in order to better engage users with information. Originality/value - At time of writing there were no literature reviews summarising the main contributions to the collaborative tagging research or debate.},

For URLs in del.icio.us, we predicted tags based on page text, anchor text, surrounding hosts, and other tags applied to the URL. We found an entropy-based metric which captures the generality of a particular tag and informs an analysis of how well that tag can be predicted. We also found that tag-based association rules can produce very high-precision predictions as well as giving deeper understanding into the relationships between tags. Our results have implications for both the study of tagging systems as potential information retrieval tools, and for the design of such systems.},

	abstract = {We present a system for personalized tag suggestion for Flickr: While the user is entering/selecting new tags for a particular picture, the system is suggesting related tags to her, based on the tags that she or other people have used in the past along with (some of) the tags already entered. The suggested tags are dynamically updated with every additional tag entered/selected. We describe three algorithms which can be applied to this problem. In experiments, our best-performing method yields an improvement in precision of 10-15% over a baseline method very similar to the system currently used by Flickr. Our system is accessible at http://ltaa5.epfl.ch/flickr-tags/.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on tag suggestion in a setting where (i) no full text information is available, such as for blogs, (ii) no item has been tagged by more than one person, such as for social bookmarking sites, and (iii) suggestions are dynamically updated, requiring efficient yet effective algorithms.},

Free form metadata or tags, as used in social bookmarking and folksonomies, have become more and more popular and successful. Such tags are relevant keywords associated with or assigned to a piece of information (e.g., a Web page), describing the item and enabling keyword-based classification. In this paper we propose P-TAG, a method which automatically generates personalized tags for Web pages. Upon browsing a Web page, P-TAG produces keywords relevant both to its textual content, but also to the data residing on the surfer's Desktop, thus expressing a personalized viewpoint. Empirical evaluations with several algorithms pursuing this approach showed very promising results. We are therefore very confident that such a user oriented automatic tagging approach can provide large scale personalized metadata annotations as an important step towards realizing the Semantic Web.},

Such systems are widely used to add keywords meta-data to photos, videos, or web pages (social bookmarking applications). The meta-data is then used by information retrieval mechanism to provide accurate query answers. To that end, the goal of collaborative tagging systems is to quickly discover the true ranking of a tag for an information object with respect to a given ranking criteria. In this paper, we consider the popularity rank as a ranking criteria. Many collaborative tagging systems help users tagging of an object by making suggestions based on the tagging history of an information object. The problem with
making tag suggestions is that they may reinforce some tags and the system fails to discover the true popularity rank of a tag for a given information object. To investigate this issue, we propose and study several algorithms for ranking and suggesting tags in collaborative tagging systems where we focus on the following design objectives: (a) learn true popularity rank, (b) make relevant suggestions, and (c) learn fast. We find that simple incremental updates of the suggestion set, which besides suggestion set size require no
configuration constants, offer good performance. Performance is evaluated by analysis and numerical results for which we used a dataset of complete tagging histories of urls that we crawled from a popular social bookmarking web service over a month period.},

They are mainly caused by the lack of semantic
information inclusion in the tagging process. We propose
a new way to describe resources: the semantic tagging. It
allows user to state semantic assertions: each of them expresses a defined characteristic of a resource associating it with a concept. We present SemKey, a semantic collaborative
tagging system, describing its global architecture and
functioning along with the most relevant organizational issues

However, when dealing with highly skewed datasets, Precision-Recall (PR) curves give a more informative picture of an algorithm's performance. We show that a deep connection exists between ROC space and PR space, such that a curve dominates in ROC space if and only if it dominates in PR space. A corollary is the notion of an achievable PR curve, which has properties much like the convex hull in ROC space; we show an efficient algorithm for computing this curve. Finally, we also note differences in the two types of curves are significant for algorithm design. For example, in PR space it is incorrect to linearly interpolate between points. Furthermore, algorithms that optimize the area under the ROC curve are not guaranteed to optimize the area under the PR curve.},

In this paper I discuss a variety of ways of evaluating the effectiveness of text categorization systems, drawing both on reported categorization experiments and on methods used in evaluating query-driven retrieval. I also consider the extent to which the same evaluation methods may be used with systems for text extraction, a more complex task. In evaluating either kind of system, the purpose for which the output is to be used is crucial in choosing appropriate evaluation methods.},

To achieve this, we first propose two time models to analyze the annotation process for two popular manual annotation approaches, i.e., tagging and browsing. The complementary properties of these approaches have inspired us to merge them to develop a hybrid annotation algorithms called frequency-based annotation. Our experiments on large-scale multimedia collections have shown that the proposed algorithm can achieve an up to 40% annotation time reduction compared with the baseline methods. In other words, it can produce considerably better results using the same annotation time.},

        abstract = {Wasps, bees, ants and termites all make effective use of their environment and resources by displaying collective "swarm" intelligence. Termite colonies - for instance - build nests with a complexity far beyond the comprehension of the individual termite, while ant colonies dynamically allocate labor to various vital tasks such as foraging or defense without any central decision-making ability. Recent research suggests that microbial life can be even richer: highly social, intricately networked, and teeming with interactions, as found in bacteria. What strikes from these observations is that both ant colonies and bacteria have similar natural mechanisms based on Stigmergy and Self-Organization in order to emerge coherent and sophisticated patterns of global foraging behavior. Keeping in mind the above characteristics we propose a Self-Regulated Swarm (SRS) algorithm which hybridizes the advantageous characteristics of Swarm Intelligence as the emergence of a societal environmental memory or cognitive map via collective pheromone laying in the landscape (properly balancing the exploration/exploitation nature of our dynamic search strategy), with a simple Evolutionary mechanism that trough a direct reproduction procedure linked to local environmental features is able to self-regulate the above exploratory swarm population, speeding it up globally. In order to test his adaptive response and robustness, we have recurred to different dynamic multimodal complex functions as well as to Dynamic Optimization Control problems, measuring reaction speeds and performance. Final comparisons were made with standard Genetic Algorithms (GAs), Bacterial Foraging strategies (BFOA), as well as with recent Co-Evolutionary approaches. SRS's were able to demonstrate quick adaptive responses, while outperforming the results obtained by the other approaches. Additionally, some successful behaviors were found: SRS was able to maintain a number of different solutions, while adapting to unforeseen situations even when over the same cooperative foraging period, the community is requested to deal with two different and contradictory purposes; the possibility to spontaneously create and maintain different subpopulations on different peaks, emerging different exploratory corridors with intelligent path planning capabilities; the ability to request for new agents (division of labor) over dramatic changing periods, and economizing those foraging resources over periods of intermediate stabilization. Finally, results illustrate that the present SRS collective swarm of bio-inspired ant-like agents is able to track about 65% of moving peaks traveling up to ten times faster than the velocity of a single individual composing that precise swarm tracking system. This emerged behavior is probably one of the most interesting ones achieved by the present work.},

SI provides a basis with wich it is possible to explore collective (or distributed) problem solving without centralized control or the provision of a global model. To tackle the formation of a coherent social collective intelligence from individual behaviors, we discuss several concepts related to Self-Organization, Stigmergy and Social Foraging in animals. Then, in a more abstract level we suggest and stress the role played not only by the environmental media as a driving force for societal learning, as well as by positive and negative feedbacks produced by the many interactions among agents. Finally, presenting a simple model based on the above features, we will adress the collective adaptation of a social community to a cultural (environmenatl, contextual) or media informational dynamical landscape, represented here - for the purpose of different experiments - by several three-dimensional mathematical functions that suddenly change over time. Results indicate that the collective intelligence is able to cope and quickly adapt to unforseen situations even when over the same cooperative foraging period, the community is requested to deal with two different and contradictory purposes.},

	abstract = {A large part of the modern web is characterized by usergenerated content categorized using collaborative tagging or folksonomy. It becomes difficult to search for relevant content because of ambiguity in lexical representation of concepts and variances in preferences of users. With more and more services relying on tags for content categorization, it is important that search techniques evolve to better suit the scenario. A promising approach towards solving these problems is to use machine common sense in conjunction with folksonomy. A past attempt to use this approach has shown positive results in finding relevant content but it does not address the issue of noise in search results. In this paper, we use the personalized web search technique of traditional web search systems to address the issue of irrelevant search results in common sense and folksonomy based search systems. In personalized web search, results are reflective of user's preferences, which are decided by search history and categories of interest. We propose modifications to personalized web search technique. Using this modified approach, we extend the basic common sense and folksonomy based search systems to address the issue of noise in search results.},

Our chief insight is that while the space of images is effectively infinite, the space of semantically differentiable scenes is actually not that large. For many image completion tasks we are able to find similar scenes which contain image fragments that will convincingly complete the image. Our algorithm is entirely data-driven, requiring no annotations or labelling by the user. Unlike existing image completion methods, our algorithm can generate a diverse set of image completions and we allow users to select among them. We demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm over existing image completion approaches.},

        abstract = {We introduce a simple but efficient, multistage algorithm for constructing concept lattices (MCA). A concept lattice can be obtained as the closure system generated from attribute concepts (dually, object concepts). There are two strategies to use this as the basis of an algorithm: (a) forming intersections by joining one attribute concept at a time, and (b) repeatedly forming pairwise intersections starting from the attribute concepts. A straightforward translation of (b) to an algorithm suggests that pairwise intersection be performed among all cumulated concepts. MCA is parsimonious in forming the pairwise intersections: it only performs such operations among the newly formed concepts from the previous stage, instead of cumulatively. We show that this parsimonious multistage strategy is complete: it generates all concepts. To make this strategy really work, one must overcome the need to eliminate duplicates (and potentially save time even further), since concepts generated at a later stage may have already appeared in one of the earlier stages. As considered in several other algorithms in the literature [5], we achieve this by an auxiliary search tree which keeps all existing concepts as paths from the root to a flagged node or a leaf. The depth of the search tree is bounded by the total number of attributes, and hence the time complexity for concept lookup is bounded by the logarithm of the total number of concepts. For constructing lattice diagrams, we adapt a sub-quadratic algorithm of Pritchard [9] for computing subset partial orders to constructing the Hasse diagrams. Instead of the standard expected quadratic complexity, the Pritchard approach achieves a worst-case time O(N2/log N). Our experimental results showed significant improvements in speed for a variety of input profiles against three leading algorithms considered in the comprehensive comparative study [5]: Bordat, Chein, and Norris.},

	abstract = {Most aspects of our private and social lives -- our safety, the integrity of the financial system, the functioning of utilities and other services, and national security -- now depend on computing. But how can we know that this computing is trustworthy? In Mechanizing Proof, Donald MacKenzie addresses this key issue by investigating the interrelations of computing, risk, and mathematical proof over the last half century from the perspectives of history and sociology. His discussion draws on the technical literature of computer science and artificial intelligence and on extensive interviews with participants.

MacKenzie argues that our culture now contains two ideals of proof: proof as traditionally conducted by human mathematicians, and formal, mechanized proof. He describes the systems constructed by those committed to the latter ideal and the many questions those systems raise about the nature of proof. He looks at the primary social influence on the development of automated proof -- the need to predict the behavior of the computer systems upon which human life and security depend -- and explores the involvement of powerful organizations such as the National Security Agency. He concludes that in mechanizing proof, and in pursuing dependable computer systems, we do not obviate the need for trust in our collective human judgment.},

We present an approach for making explicit the semantics behind the tag space in social tagging systems, so that this collaborative organization can emerge in the form of partial ontologies. This is achieved by using a combination of shallow pre-processing strategies and statistical techniques together with knowledge provided by ontologies available on the semantic web. Preliminary results on the Del.icio.us and Flickr tag sets showed that the approach is very promising: it generates clusters with highly related tags corresponding to concepts in ontologies, and meaningful relationships among subsets of these tags can be identified.},

    abstract = {A key argument for modeling knowledge in ontologies is the easy re-use and re-engineering of the knowledge. However, current ontology engineering tools provide only basic functionalities for analyzing ontologies. Since ontologies can be considered as graphs, graph analysis techniques are a suitable answer for this need. Graph analysis has been performed by sociologists for over 60 years, and resulted in the vivid research area of Social Network Analysis (SNA). While social network structures currently receive high attention in the Semantic Web community, there are only very
 few SNA applications, and virtually none for analyzing the
 structure of ontologies.

We illustrate the benefits of applying SNA to ontologies and the Semantic Web, and discuss which research topics arise on the edge between the two areas. In particular, we discuss how different notions of centrality describe the core content and structure of an ontology. From the rather simple notion of degree centrality over betweenness centrality to the more complex eigenvector centrality, we illustrate the insights these measures provide on two ontologies, which are different in purpose, scope, and size.},

Web Mining aims at discovering insights about the meaning of Web

of data Web mining operates on, the discovery of meaning is
impossible based on these data only. Therefore, formalizations of
the semantics of Web resources and navigation behavior are
increasingly being used.  This fits exactly with the aims of the
Semantic Web: the Semantic Web enriches the WWW by
machine-processable information which supports the user in his
tasks. In this paper, we discuss the interplay of the Semantic Web
with Web Mining, with a specific focus on usage mining.},

        abstract = {Text document clustering plays an important role in providing intuitive
navigation and browsing mechanisms by organizing large amounts of information
into a small number of meaningful clusters. Standard partitional or agglomerative
clustering methods efficiently compute results to this end.
However, the bag of words representation used for these clustering methods is often
unsatisfactory as it ignores relationships between important terms that do not
co-occur literally. Also, it is mostly left to the user to find out why a particular partitioning
has been achieved, because it is only specified extensionally. In order to
deal with the two problems, we integrate background knowledge into the process of
clustering text documents.
First, we preprocess the texts, enriching their representations by background knowledge
provided in a core ontology — in our application Wordnet. Then, we cluster
the documents by a partitional algorithm. Our experimental evaluation on Reuters
newsfeeds compares clustering results with pre-categorizations of news. In the experiments,
improvements of results by background knowledge compared to the baseline
can be shown for many interesting tasks.
Second, the clustering partitions the large number of documents to a relatively small
number of clusters, which may then be analyzed by conceptual clustering. In our approach,
we applied Formal Concept Analysis. Conceptual clustering techniques are
known to be too slow for directly clustering several hundreds of documents, but they
give an intensional account of cluster results. They allow for a concise description
of commonalities and distinctions of different clusters. With background knowledge
they even find abstractions like “food” (vs. specializations like “beef” or “corn”).
Thus, in our approach, partitional clustering reduces first the size of the problem
such that it becomes tractable for conceptual clustering, which then facilitates the
understanding of the results.},

    abstract = {Wikis are social web sites enabling a potentially large number of
	participants
	
	 to modify any page or create a new page using their web browser.
	As
	
	 they grow, wikis suffer from a number of problems (anarchical structure,
	large
	
	 number of pages, aging navigation paths, etc.). We believe that semantic
	wikis
	
	 can improve navigation and search. In SweetWiki we investigate the
	use of semantic
	
	 web technologies to support and ease the lifecycle of the wiki. The
	very
	
	 model of wikis was declaratively described: an OWL schema captures
	concepts
	
	 such as WikiWord, wiki page, forward and backward link, author, etc.
	This ontology
	
	 is then exploited by an embedded semantic search engine (Corese).
	In
	
	 addition, SweetWiki integrates a standard WYSIWYG editor (Kupu) that
	we
	
	 extended to support semantic annotation following the "social tagging"
	approach
	
	 made popular by web sites such as flickr.com. When editing a page,
	the
	
	 user can freely enter some keywords in an AJAX-powered textfield
	and an
	
	 auto-completion mechanism proposes existing keywords by issuing SPARQL
	
	 queries to identify existing concepts with compatible labels. Thus
	tagging is
	
	 both easy (keyword-like) and motivating (real time display of the
	number of related
	
	 pages) and concepts are collected as in folksonomies. To maintain
	and reengineer
	
	 the folksonomy, we reused a web-based editor available in the underlying
	
	 semantic web server to edit semantic web ontologies and annotations.
	
	 Unlike in other wikis, pages are stored directly in XHTML ready to
	be served
	
	 and semantic annotations are embedded in the pages themselves using
	RDF/A.
	
	 If someone sends or copy a page, the annotations follow it, and if
	an application
	
	 crawls the wiki site it can extract the metadata and reuse them.},

    abstract = {Due to their low entry barrier, easy deployment, and simple
	
	 yet powerful features, wikis have gained popularity for agile knowledge
	
	 management in communities of almost all sizes. Semantic wikis strive
	
	 to give entered information more structure in order to allow automatic
	
	 processing of the wiki’s contents. This facilitates enhanced navigation
	
	 and search in the wiki itself as well as simple reuse of information

	 external applications or for generating different views on the same
	information.
	
	 This makes semantic wikis especially interesting for corporate
	
	 intranet deployment, implementing the Semantic Intranet. In this
	paper,
	
	 we will have a look at Kaukolu, an open source semantic wiki prototype,

	 existing Web content is the lack of domain ontologies. While FOAF
	and Dublin
	
	 Core are popular means for expressing relationships between Web resources
	
	 and between Web resources and literal values, we widely lack unique
	identifiers
	
	 for common concepts and instances. Also, most available ontologies
	have a
	
	 very weak community grounding in the sense that they are designed
	by single
	
	 individuals or small groups of individuals, while the majority of
	potential users
	
	 is not involved in the process of proposing new ontology elements
	or achieving
	
	 consensus. This is in sharp contrast to natural language where the
	evolution of
	
	 the vocabulary is under the control of the user community. At the
	same time,
	
	 we can observe that, within Wiki communities, especially Wikipedia,
	a large
	
	 number of users is able to create comprehensive domain representations
	in the
	
	 sense of unique, machine-feasible, identifiers and concept definitions
	which are
	
	 sufficient for humans to grasp the intension of the concepts. The
	English
	
	 version of Wikipedia contains now more than one million entries and
	thus the
	
	 same amount of URIs plus a human-readable description. While this
	collection
	
	 is on the lower end of ontology expressiveness, it is likely the
	largest living
	
	 ontology that is available today. In this paper, we (1) show that
	standard Wiki
	
	 technology can be easily used as an ontology development environment
	for
	
	 named classes, reducing entry barriers for the participation of users
	in the
	
	 creation and maintenance of lightweight ontologies, (2) prove that
	the URIs of
	
	 Wikipedia entries are surprisingly reliable identifiers for ontology
	concepts, and
	
	 (3) demonstrate the applicability of our approach in a use case.},

an appropriate size and complexity of the explaining lattice of

Current search technologies work in a "one size fits all" fashion. Therefore, the answer to a query is independent of specific user information need. In this paper we describe a novel ranking technique for personalized search servicesthat combines content-based and community-based evidences. The community-based information is used in order to provide context for queries andis influenced by the current interaction of the user with the service. Ouralgorithm is evaluated using data derived from an actual service available on the Web an online bookstore. We show that the quality of content-based ranking strategies can be improved by the use of communityinformation as another evidential source of relevance. In our experiments the improvements reach up to 48% in terms of average precision.},

    abstract = {Discovering underlying structure from co-occurrence data is an important task in many fields, including: insurance, intelligence, criminal investigation, epidemiology, human resources, and marketing. For example a store may wish to identify underlying sets of items purchased together or a human resources department may wish to identify groups of employees that collaborate with each other.

Previously Kubica et. al. presented the group detection algorithm (GDA) - an algorithm for finding underlying groupings of entities from co-occurrence data. This algorithm is based on a probabilistic generative model and produces coherent groups that are consistent with prior knowledge. Unfortunately, the optimization used in GDA is slow, making it potentially infeasible for many real world data sets.

To this end, we present k-groups - an algorithm that uses an approach similar to that of k-means (hard clustering and localized updates) to significantly accelerate the discovery of the underlying groups while retaining GDA's probabilistic model. In addition, we show that k-groups is guaranteed to converge to a local minimum. We also compare the performance of GDA and k-groups on several real world and artificial data sets, showing that k-groups' sacrifice in solution quality is significantly offset by its increase in speed. This trade-off makes group detection tractable on significantly larger data sets.},

    abstract = {The investigation of community structures in networks is an important issue
in many domains and disciplines. This problem is relevant for social tasks
(objective analysis of relationships on the web), biological inquiries
(functional studies in metabolic, cellular or protein networks) or
technological problems (optimization of large infrastructures). Several types
of algorithm exist for revealing the community structure in networks, but a
general and quantitative definition of community is still lacking, leading to
an intrinsic difficulty in the interpretation of the results of the algorithms
without any additional non-topological information. In this paper we face this
problem by introducing two quantitative definitions of community and by showing
how they are implemented in practice in the existing algorithms. In this way
the algorithms for the identification of the community structure become fully
self-contained. Furthermore, we propose a new local algorithm to detect
communities which outperforms the existing algorithms with respect to the
computational cost, keeping the same level of reliability. The new algorithm is
tested on artificial and real-world graphs. In particular we show the
application of the new algorithm to a network of scientific collaborations,
which, for its size, can not be attacked with the usual methods. This new class
of local algorithms could open the way to applications to large-scale
technological and biological applications.},

Researchers have concentrated particularly on a few properties that seem to be common to many networks: the small-world property, power-law degree distributions, and network transitivity. In this article, we highlight another property that is found in many networks, the property of community structure, in which network nodes are joined together in tightly knit groups, between which there are only looser connections. We propose a method for detecting such communities, built around the idea of using centrality indices to find community boundaries. We test our method on computer-generated and real-world graphs whose community structure is already known and find that the method detects this known structure with high sensitivity and reliability. We also apply the method to two networks whose community structure is not well known---a collaboration network and a food web---and find that it detects significant and informative community divisions in both cases.},

        abstract = {As one of the most successful applications of image analysis and understanding, face recognition has recently received significant attention, especially during the past several years. At least two reasons account for this trend: the first is the wide range of commercial and law enforcement applications, and the second is the availability of feasible technologies after 30 years of research. Even though current machine recognition systems have reached a certain level of maturity, their success is limited by the conditions imposed by many real applications. For example, recognition of face images acquired in an outdoor environment with changes in illumination and/or pose remains a largely unsolved problem. In other words, current systems are still far away from the capability of the human perception system.This paper provides an up-to-date critical survey of still- and video-based face recognition research. There are two underlying motivations for us to write this survey paper: the first is to provide an up-to-date review of the existing literature, and the second is to offer some insights into the studies of machine recognition of faces. To provide a comprehensive survey, we not only categorize existing recognition techniques but also present detailed descriptions of representative methods within each category. In addition, relevant topics such as psychophysical studies, system evaluation, and issues of illumination and pose variation are covered.},

        abstract = { Many real-world graphs have been shown to be scale-free---vertex degrees follow power law distributions, vertices tend to cluster, and the average length of all shortest paths is small. We present a new model for understanding scale-free networks based on multilevel geodesic approximation, using a new data structure called a multilevel mesh.Using this multilevel framework, we propose a new kind of graph clustering for data reduction of very large graph systems such as social, biological, or electronic networks. Finally, we apply our algorithms to real-world social networks and protein interaction graphs to show that they can reveal knowledge embedded in underlying graph structures. We also demonstrate how our data structures can be used to quickly answer approximate distance and shortest path queries on scale-free networks.

Bibliographic attribute extraction can be used in two ways. One is reference parsing in which attribute values are extracted from OCR-processed references for bibliographic matching. The other is reference alignment in which attribute values are aligned to the bibliographic record to enrich the vocabulary of the bibliographic database. In this paper, we first propose a statistical model for attribute extraction that represents both the syntactical structure of references and OCR error patterns. Then, we perform experiments using bibliographic references obtained from scanned images of papers in journals and transactions and show that useful attribute values are extracted from OCR-processed references. We also show that the proposed model has advantages in reducing the cost of preparing training data, a critical problem in rule-based systems.},

        abstract = {A semantic file system is an information storage system that provides flexible associative access to the system's contents by automatically extracting attributes from files with file type specific transducers. Associative access is provided by a conservative extension to existing tree-structured file system protocols, and by protocols that are designed specifically for content based access. Compatiblity with existing file system protocols is provided by introducing the concept of a virtual directory. Virtual directory names are interpreted as queries, and thus provide flexible associative access to files and directories in a manner compatible with existing software. Rapid attribute-based access to file system contents is implemented by automatic extraction and indexing of key properties of file system objects. The automatic indexing of files and directories is called "semantic" because user programmable transducers use information about the semantics of updated file system objects to extract the properties for indexing. Experimental results from a semantic file system implementation support the thesis that semantic file systems present a more effective storage abstraction than do traditional tree structured file systems for information sharing and command level programming.},

This system builds upon the work of semantic desktop systems such as Gnowsis and Haystack, exploring the ways that ontological information may be integrated into an existing desktop environment. The major contribution of this work is the introduction of the idea of ‘reflections’ between information models as a formal basis for integrating a shared information system with existing applications. The success of this work is intended to be judged by its ease of use for developers, the completeness of the model reflection and its efficiency. According to these criteria the design implemented may be judged a partial success, achieving an easy-to-use reflection which is practically too slow to use in general purpose systems. The work does, however, suggest means to improve this in future systems in order to bring about a fully-integrated, evolutionary semantic desktop system.},

    abstract = {RDF(S)1 constitutes a newly emerging standard for metadata that is about to turn the World Wide Web into a machine-understandable knowledge base. It is an XML application that allows for the denotation of facts and schemata in a web-compatible format, building on an elaborate objectmodel for describing concepts and relations. Thus, it might turn up as a natural choice for a widely-useable ontology description language. However, its lack of capabilities for describing the semantics of concepts and relations beyond those provided by inheritance mechanisms makes it a rather weak language for even the most austere knowledge-based system. This paper presents an approach for modeling ontologies in RDF(S) that also considers axioms as objects that are describable in RDF(S). Thus, we provide flexible, extensible, and adequate means for accessing and exchanging axioms in RDF(S). Our approach follows the spirit of the World Wide Web, as we do not assume a global axiom specification language that is too intractable for one purpose and too weak for the next, but rather a methodology that allows (communities of) users to specify what axioms are interesting in their domain.},
