1) Remove possible write-locks on startup
      
3) Startup
   - don't crash on wrong configuration
   -> assume default values or disable lucene search

4) remove deprecated queries

6) implement multiple deletion by multi-term-search

7) centralize FLD_* constants (probably via spring?!)

8) deal with group-tas!

9) Implements single application context for lucene

Lucene 4.9 Migration:
- LuceneGoldStandardManager(Test): - Problems may related to DiacriticsLowerCaseFilteringAnalyzer!
		
- IndexReaders read only
	-> LuceneResourceIndex: - Have a second look on Reader/Writer management
	
- LuceneResourceSearch		- Search Terms have to be UTF 8 - (BytesRef)
							- parseSearchQuery(final String fieldName, String searchTerms)
								--> Why was it Version.LUCENE_24 ???
							- maybe switch to Search Manager
							
- LuceneResourceSearchTest	- no asserts!							
							
- General:
	- Make Indexing/Searching threaded!
