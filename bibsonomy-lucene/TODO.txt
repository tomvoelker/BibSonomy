1) Remove possible write-locks on startup
2) Startup
   - handle possibly lost flagged spammers 
   (spammers where flagged, but bibsonomy crashed before the index was updated)
   
   -> on startup: get all users which where flagged as spammers/non-spammers in time 
      t >= lastLogDate-epsilon
      
3) Startup
   - don't crash on wrong configuration
   -> assume default values or disable lucene search

4) remove deprecated queries

5) flagged spammers get lost on crash
   -> recovery on startup OR use a sql-table for caching 
   
6) implement multiple deletion by multi-term-search

7) centralize FLD_* constants (probably via spring?!)
