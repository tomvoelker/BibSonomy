1) Remove possible write-locks on startup
      
3) Startup
   - don't crash on wrong configuration
   -> assume default values or disable lucene search

4) remove deprecated queries

6) implement multiple deletion by multi-term-search

7) centralize FLD_* constants (probably via spring?!)

8) deal with group-tas!

9) Implements single application context for lucene

Lucene 4.9 Migration:

- Tests: -Index deletion fails, cause of Lucene not releasing File-handles on .cfs-Files
			-> on Windows those files can't!! be deleted as long as the JVM is still running...
				-> Shouldn't be a problem under Linux
							
- LuceneResourceSearchTest	- no asserts!				
							
- General:
	- Make Indexing/Searching threaded!
