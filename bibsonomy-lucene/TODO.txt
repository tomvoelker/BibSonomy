1) Remove possible write-locks on startup
2) Use post's date and not its change_date
   -> we need a different way for keeping track of indexe's last post
      (e.g. add a change_date column)
3) Re-Implement 'optimize index' handling
4) Cache Flagging of spammers
   -> TreeSet<String> spamUserNames
   -> check posts prior insertion against this list
