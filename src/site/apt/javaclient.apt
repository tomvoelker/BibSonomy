Java client library

  The Java library encapsulates each accessing method provided by the webservice
  (see {{{api.html}methods}}) with a corresponding class. The client library
  can be downloaded from {{{download.html}here}}.

  The client library consists of multiple jars which must be added to your
  Java project's classpath. Those jars are: 

  * <<Bibsonomy webservice>>:\
    The webservice client itself consists of four jars:

    * <<<bibsonomy-rest-client.jar>>> (client library classes)
    
    * <<<bibsonomy-rest-common.jar>>> (REST API core classes)
    
    * <<<bibsonomy-model.jar>>> (bibsonomy data model classes)

    * <<<bibsonomy-common.jar>>> (shared library of bibsonomy).

  * <<Apache HTTP-Client>>:\
    The HTTP client libraries by the apache software foundation are used for the
    HTTP communication:

    * <<<commons-httpclient.jar>>> which uses 
    
    * <<<commons-codec.jar>>> and
    
    * <<<commons-logging.jar>>>.
    
  * <<Java Architecture for XML Binding>> (JAXB):\
    The client uses JAXB to (de)serialize the XML exchange documents:

    * <<<jaxb-api.jar>>>

    * <<<jsr173_api.jar>>>

    * <<<activation.jar>>>


* Using the client library

  Using the client library is rather simple. At first one has to instantiate an object of
  type <<<Bibsonomy>>> and set the user's credentials on it. This object can be reused during
  program run. As already discussed, there exist classes encapsulating each provided
  webservice method. These classes are derived from <<<AbstractQuery>>> and request in
  their constructor parameters (usually model data objects, see the package
  <<<org.bibsonomy.model>>>) - please refer to the JavaDoc of the corresponding constructor.

  After instantiating an appropriate <<<AbstractQuery>>> just execute it by invoking
  the <<<executeQuery>>> method of the <<<Bibsonomy>>> object with the query object
  as parameter. If your query object fetches a list of objects, for example a list of
  posts, you can also use the overloaded <<<executeQuery>>> method and register a callback
  object (use the <<<ProgressCallback>>> interface). The return values of your query are
  available via the <<<getResult>>> and <<<getHttpStatusCode>>> methods of the <<<AbstractQuery>>>. 

  Here is a simple example of how to use the client library:

--------------------------------------------
  // create webservice client object
  Bibsonomy bib = new Bibsonomy( "myUserName", "mySecretPassword" );

  // instantiate query object
  GetPostsQuery gpq = new GetPostsQuery();

  // some queries can be parametrized
  // -> in this example we want to fetch only bibtex entries
  gpq.setResourceType( BibTex.class );

  try {
    // perform query
    bib.executeQuery( gpq );

    // on success, read results
    if( gpq.getHttpStatusCode() == 200 ) {
      List<Post> posts = gpq.getResult();

      for( Post post: posts ) {
      /*
       * now do something with your posts :)
       */
      }
    }
  } catch( ErrorPerformingRequestException e ) {
    /*
     * happens on network failure for example
     */
  }
--------------------------------------------

  A whole example application for managing bookmarks and publications, demonstrating the 
  webservice client library, is available for {{{download.html}download}}.
